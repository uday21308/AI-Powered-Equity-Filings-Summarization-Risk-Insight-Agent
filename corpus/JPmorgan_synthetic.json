As a result of the \nreorganization, the Firm has three reportable business \nsegments \u2013 Consumer & Community Banking (\u201cCCB\u201d), \nCommercial & Investment Bank (\u201cCIB\u201d) and Asset & \nWealth Management (\u201cAWM\u201d) \u2013 with the remaining \nactivities in Corporate.

The Firm\u2019s businesses generally compete on \nthe basis of the quality and variety of the Firm\u2019s \nproducts and services, transaction execution, \ninnovation, reputation and price. Competition also \nvaries based on the types of clients, customers, \nindustries and geographies served. With respect to \nsome of its geographies and products, \nJPMorganChase competes globally; with respect to \nothers, the Firm competes on a national or regional \nbasis. New competitors in the financial services \nindustry continue to emerge, including firms that offer \nproducts and services solely through the internet and \nnon-financial companies that offer products and \nservices that disintermediate traditional banking \nproducts and services offered by financial services \nfirms such as JPMorganChase.\nPart I\n1\nSupervision and regulation\nThe Firm is subject to extensive and comprehensive \nregulation under U.S. federal and state laws, as well as \nthe applicable laws of the jurisdictions outside the U.S. \nin which the Firm does business.  \nFinancial holding company:\nConsolidated supervision. JPMorgan Chase & Co. is a \nbank holding company (\u201cBHC\u201d) and a financial holding \ncompany (\u201cFHC\u201d) under U.S. federal law, and is subject \nto comprehensive consolidated supervision, \nregulation and examination by the Board of Governors \nof the Federal Reserve System (the \u201cFederal Reserve\u201d). \nThe Federal Reserve acts as the supervisor of the \nconsolidated operations of BHCs. Certain of \nJPMorganChase\u2019s subsidiaries are also regulated \ndirectly by additional authorities based on the \nactivities or licenses of those subsidiaries.\nJPMorganChase\u2019s national bank subsidiary, JPMorgan \nChase Bank, N.A., is supervised and regulated by the \nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency (\u201cOCC\u201d) and, \nwith respect to certain matters, by the Federal Deposit \nInsurance Corporation (the \u201cFDIC\u201d).\nJPMorganChase\u2019s U.S. broker-dealers are supervised \nand regulated by the Securities and Exchange \nCommission (\u201cSEC\u201d) and the Financial Industry \nRegulatory Authority (\u201cFINRA\u201d). Subsidiaries of the \nFirm that engage in certain futures-related and swaps-\nrelated activities are supervised and regulated by the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission (\u201cCFTC\u201d). \nJ.P. Morgan Securities plc holds a banking license in \nthe U.K. and is regulated by the U.K. Prudential \nRegulation Authority (the \u201cPRA\u201d) and the U.K. Financial \nConduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d). \nJPMSE is a Germany-based credit institution jointly \nregulated by the European Central Bank (\u201cECB\u201d), the \nGerman Financial Supervisory Authority and the \nGerman Central Bank, as well as the local regulators in \neach of the countries in which it operates. The Firm\u2019s \nother non-U.S. subsidiaries are regulated by the \nbanking, securities, prudential, payments and conduct \nregulatory authorities, as applicable, in the countries in \nwhich they operate. \nPermissible business activities. The Bank Holding \nCompany Act restricts BHCs from engaging in \nbusiness activities other than the business of banking \nand certain closely-related activities. FHCs are \npermitted to engage in a broader range of financial \nactivities. The Federal Reserve has the authority to \nlimit an FHC\u2019s ability to conduct otherwise permissible \nactivities if the FHC or any of its depository institution \nsubsidiaries ceases to meet applicable eligibility \nrequirements. The Federal Reserve may also impose \ncorrective capital and/or managerial requirements on \nthe FHC, and if deficiencies are persistent, may require \ndivestiture of the FHC\u2019s depository institutions. If any \ndepository institution controlled by an FHC fails to \nmaintain a satisfactory rating under the Community \nReinvestment Act, the Federal Reserve must prohibit \nthe FHC and its subsidiaries from engaging in any new \nactivities other than those permissible for BHCs, or \nacquiring a company engaged in such activities. \nCapital and liquidity requirements. The Federal \nReserve establishes capital, liquidity and leverage \nrequirements for JPMorganChase that are generally \nconsistent with the international Basel III capital and \nliquidity framework and evaluates the Firm\u2019s \ncompliance with those requirements. The OCC \nestablishes similar requirements for JPMorgan Chase \nBank, N.A. Certain of the Firm\u2019s non-U.S. subsidiaries \nand branches are also subject to local capital and \nliquidity requirements.\nBanking supervisors globally continue to refine and \nenhance the Basel III capital framework for financial \ninstitutions. In July 2023, U.S. banking regulators \nreleased a proposal to amend the U.S. risk-based \ncapital framework to incorporate certain elements of \nthe revised international Basel III capital framework. \nThe proposal would significantly revise risk-based \ncapital requirements for banks with assets of $100 \nbillion or more, including the Firm and other U.S. global \nsystemically important banks (\"GSIBs\"). Finalization of \nthe proposal, including the required implementation \ndate, is uncertain. The Firm continues to monitor \ndevelopments and potential impacts.\nIn the EU and U.K., regulators have finalized the rules \nimplementing their Basel III frameworks. The new rules \nbecame effective in the EU beginning January 1, 2025, \nwith market risk aspects delayed until January 1, 2026. \nIn January 2025, the PRA announced that it intends to \ndelay the implementation of the new rules in the U.K. to \nJanuary 1, 2027. There are certain transitional \narrangements applicable in both the EU and U.K. until \n2032 and 2030, respectively.\nStress tests. As a large BHC, JPMorganChase is \nsubject to supervisory stress testing administered by \nthe Federal Reserve as part of the Federal Reserve\u2019s \nannual Comprehensive Capital ",
    "Risk Factors": "Summary\nThe principal risk factors that could adversely affect \nJPMorganChase\u2019s business, results of operations, \nfinancial condition, capital position, liquidity, \ncompetitive position or reputation include:\n\u2022 Regulatory risks, including the impact that \napplicable laws, rules and regulations in the highly-\nregulated and supervised financial services industry, \nas well as changes to or in the application, \ninterpretation or enforcement of those laws, rules \nand regulations, can have on JPMorganChase\u2019s \nbusiness and operations, including JPMorganChase \nincurring additional costs associated with \nassessments, levies or other governmental charges; \nthe ways in which differences in financial services \nregulation and supervision in different jurisdictions \nor with respect to certain competitors can negatively \nimpact JPMorganChase\u2019s business; the ways in \nwhich governmental policies that discourage or \npenalize business relationships with clients in \ncertain industries, or require specific business \npractices, can negatively affect JPMorganChase's \nbusinesses; the penalties and collateral \nconsequences, and higher compliance and \noperational costs, that JPMorganChase may incur \nwhen resolving a regulatory investigation; the ways \nin which less predictable legal and regulatory \nframeworks in certain jurisdictions can negatively \nimpact JPMorganChase\u2019s operations and financial \nresults; and the losses that security holders and \nother unsecured creditors will absorb if \nJPMorganChase were to enter into a resolution. \u2022 Strategic risks, including the damage to \nJPMorganChase\u2019s competitive standing and results \nthat could occur if management fails to develop and \nexecute effective business strategies; risks \nassociated with the significant and increasing \ncompetition that JPMorganChase faces; and the \npotential adverse impacts of climate change on the \nPart I\n10\neffectiveness of JPMorganChase\u2019s existing business \nstrategies with respect to its operations, clients and \ncustomers. Failure to discover or address emerging threats, \nknown vulnerabilities or shortcomings in cybersecurity \ncontrols, or to prioritize or complete enhancements to \naddress them, in each case in a timely manner, may \nleave JPMorganChase vulnerable to cyber attacks, \npotentially resulting in data breaches, financial losses, \nPart I\n24\nreputational damage and regulatory penalties, \nincluding the failure to prioritize or complete \nenhancements relating to:\n\u2022 preventing unauthorized access and protecting \nagainst the misuse of access, including the \nmaintenance and enhancement of controls related \nto secure software development practices and \nidentity and access management, such as those \nrelating to the management of administrative access \nto systems\n\u2022 detecting, escalating and addressing effectively and \nin a timely manner any vulnerabilities that may be \npresent either in internally-developed software or \nexternally-provided software or services, including \nvulnerabilities that could allow attackers to exploit \nunknown security flaws in software and hardware \n(\u201czero-day vulnerabilities\u201d)\n\u2022 oversight of third-party vendors and early detection \nof attacks against those vendors, including \nransomware attacks and attacks targeting \nvulnerabilities in third-party open-source software, \nin support of the secure development and \nmaintenance of internal systems\n\u2022 maintaining and enhancing controls related to \ntechnology asset management and inventory \nsystems to prevent the risk of undetected \nvulnerabilities that could undermine \nJPMorganChase\u2019s ability to operate an effective \ncontrol process \n\u2022 upgrading the coverage and capabilities of systems \nand controls to protect JPMorganChase and its \nclients and customers from the impact of distributed \ndenial-of-service attacks, or to recover from outages \nthat could be caused by a malware or ransomware \nattack\n\u2022 the continuing migration of client-facing services to \nthe cloud, and modernization of those services\n\u2022 strengthening network security and managing \noutbound connections to reduce the risk of data loss \n\u2022 identifying, assessing and mitigating insider threat \nactivities that could lead to the misuse of \nJPMorganChase\u2019s systems or client and customer \ninformation, and\n\u2022 integrating acquired businesses where system \nintegration may be complex or may require \nextensive and lengthy remediation or enhancement \nof controls. Potential adverse impacts of \nclimate-related physical risks to JPMorganChase, its \nclients or customers include:\n\u2022 declines in asset values, including due to the \ndestruction or degradation of property\n\u2022 reduced availability or increased cost of insurance \nfor clients of JPMorganChase\n\u2022 interruptions to business operations, including \nsupply chain disruption, and\n\u2022 population migration or unemployment in affected \nregions. \u2022 Liquidity risks, including the risk that \nJPMorganChase\u2019s liquidity could be impaired by \nmarket-wide illiquidity or disruption, unforeseen \nliquidity or capital requirements, the inability to sell \nassets, default by a significant market participant, \nunanticipated outflows of cash or collateral, or lack \nof market or customer confidence in \nJPMorganChase; the dependence of JPMorgan \nChase & Co. \u2022 Operational risks, including risks associated with \nJPMorganChase\u2019s dependence on its operational \nsystems and its employees, as well as the systems \nand employees of third parties, market participants \nand service providers; the potential negative effects \nof failing to identify and address operational risks \nrelated to the failure of internal or external \noperational systems, the introduction of or changes \nto products, services and delivery platforms or the \nadoption of new technologies; risks related to \nsafeguarding personal information; the harm that \ncould be caused by a successful cyber attack \naffecting JPMorganChase or by other extraordinary \nevents; risks associated with JPMorganChase\u2019s risk \nmanagement framework and control environment, \nits models and estimations and associated \njudgments used in its stress testing and financial \nstatements, and controls over disclosure and \nfinancial reporting; and potential adverse effects of \nfailing to comply with applicable standards for the \noversight of vendors and other service providers. \u2022 Reputation risks, including the potential adverse \neffects on JPMorganChase\u2019s relationships with its \nclients, customers, shareholders, regulators and \nother stakeholders that could arise from employee \nmisconduct, security breaches, inadequate risk \nmanagement, compliance or operational failures, \nlitigation and regulatory investigations, failure to \nsatisfy expectations concerning environmental, \nsocial and governance concerns, failure to \neffectively manage conflicts of interest or to satisfy \nfiduciary obligations, or other factors that could \ndamage JPMorganChase\u2019s reputation. \u2022 Country risks, including potential impacts on \nJPMorganChase\u2019s businesses from an outbreak or \nescalation of hostilities between countries or within a \ncountry or region; and the potential adverse effects \nof local economic, political, regulatory and social \nfactors on JPMorganChase\u2019s business and revenues \nin certain countries in which it operates. JPMorganChase\u2019s earnings from its consumer \nbusinesses could also be adversely affected by \ngovernmental policies and actions that affect \nconsumers, including:\n\u2022 policies and initiatives relating to medical insurance, \neducation, immigration and housing, or that may \nimpact employment status\n\u2022 laws, rules and regulations relating specifically to the \nfinancial services industry, such as limitations on late \npayment, overdraft and interchange fees, and\n\u2022 policies aimed at the economy more broadly, such \nas higher taxes and increased regulation, which \ncould result in reductions in consumer disposable \nincome. On the other hand, a low or negative interest rate \nenvironment may cause:\n\u2022 net interest margins to be compressed, which could \nreduce the amounts that JPMorganChase earns on \nits investment securities portfolio to the extent that it \nis unable to reinvest contemporaneously in higher-\nyielding instruments\n\u2022 unanticipated or adverse changes in depositor \nbehavior, which could negatively affect \nJPMorganChase\u2019s broader asset and liability \nmanagement strategy, and\n\u2022 a reduction in the value of JPMorganChase\u2019s \nmortgage servicing rights (\u201cMSRs\u201d) asset, resulting \nin decreased revenues. JPMorganChase\u2019s \nfunding costs could also be negatively affected by \nactions that JPMorganChase may take in order to:\n\u2022 satisfy applicable liquidity coverage ratio and net \nstable funding ratio requirements\n\u2022 address obligations under its resolution plan, or\n\u2022 satisfy regulatory requirements in jurisdictions \noutside the U.S. Any failure by or inability of JPMorganChase to \nmaintain the required level and composition of capital, \nor unfavorable changes in applicable capital \nrequirements, could have an adverse impact on \nJPMorganChase\u2019s shareholders, such as:\n\u2022 reducing the amount of common stock that \nJPMorganChase is permitted to repurchase\n\u2022 requiring the issuance of, or prohibiting the \nredemption of, capital instruments in a manner \ninconsistent with JPMorganChase\u2019s capital \nmanagement strategy\n\u2022 constraining the amount of dividends that may be \npaid on common stock, or\n\u2022 curtailing JPMorganChase\u2019s business activities or \noperations. Furthermore, the widespread and expanding \ninterconnectivity among financial institutions, clearing \nbanks, CCPs, payments processors, financial \ntechnology companies, securities exchanges, clearing \nhouses and other financial market infrastructures \nincreases the risk that the disruption of an operational \nsystem involving one institution or entity, including \ndue to a cyber attack, may cause industry-wide \noperational disruptions that could materially affect \nJPMorganChase\u2019s ability to conduct business. Any such impact could, in turn, reduce \n31\nJPMorganChase\u2019s revenues. Risk Factors. In 2023, U.S. None.",
