    "Business": "Business\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents incorporated herein by reference contain forward-looking statements based on expectations,\nestimates, and projections as of the date of this filing. Actual results and outcomes may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements.\nSee Item 1A of Part I \u2014 \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d As used herein, \u201cAmazon.com,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d and similar terms include Amazon.com, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless\nthe context indicates otherwise.\nGeneral\nWe seek to be Earth\u2019s most customer-centric company. We are guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for\ninvention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. In each of our segments, we serve our primary customer sets, consisting of\nconsumers, sellers, developers, enterprises, content creators, advertisers, and employees.\nWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and Amazon Web Services (\u201cAWS\u201d). These segments reflect the\nway the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations. Information on our net sales is contained in Item 8 of Part II, \u201cFinancial\nStatements and Supplementary Data \u2014 Note 10 \u2014 Segment Information.\u201d\nConsumers\nWe serve consumers through our online and physical stores and focus on selection, price, and convenience. We design our stores to enable hundreds of\nmillions of unique products to be sold by us and by third parties across dozens of product categories. Customers access our offerings through our websites,\nmobile apps, Alexa, devices, streaming, and physically visiting our stores. We also manufacture and sell electronic devices, including Kindle, Fire tablet, Fire\nTV, Echo, Ring, Blink, and eero, and we develop and produce media content. We seek to offer our customers low prices, fast and free delivery, easy-to-use\nfunctionality, and timely customer service. In addition, we offer subscription services such as Amazon Prime, a membership program that includes fast, free\nshipping on tens of millions of items, access to award-winning movies and series, live sports, and other benefits.\nWe fulfill customer orders in a number of ways, including through: North America and International fulfillment networks that we operate; co-sourced and\noutsourced arrangements in certain countries; digital delivery; and through our physical stores. We operate customer service centers globally, which are\nsupplemented by co-sourced arrangements. See Item 2 of Part I, \u201cProperties.\u201d\nSellers\nWe offer programs that enable sellers to grow their businesses, sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders using our services. We are not the seller\nof record in these transactions. We earn fixed fees, a percentage of sales, per-unit activity fees, interest, or some combination thereof, for our seller programs.\nDevelopers and Enterprises\nWe serve developers and enterprises of all sizes, including start-ups, government agencies, and academic institutions, through AWS, which offers a broad\nset of on-demand technology services, including compute, storage, database, analytics, and machine learning, and other services.\nContent Creators\nWe offer programs that allow authors, independent publishers, musicians, filmmakers, Twitch streamers, skill and app developers, and others to publish\nand sell content.\nAdvertisers\nWe provide advertising services to sellers, vendors, publishers, authors, and others, through programs such as sponsored ads, display, and video\nadvertising.\n3\nTable of Contents\nCompetition\nOur businesses encompass a large variety of product types, service offerings, and delivery channels. The worldwide marketplace in which we compete is\nevolving rapidly and intensely competitive, and we face a broad array of competitors from many different industry sectors around the world. Our current and\npotential competitors include: (1) physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retailers, publishers, vendors, distributors, manufacturers, and producers of the\nproducts we offer and sell to consumers and businesses; (2) publishers, producers, and distributors of physical, digital, and interactive media of all types and all\ndistribution channels; (3) web search engines, comparison shopping websites, social networks, web portals, virtual assistants, and other online and app-based\nmeans of discovering, using, or acquiring goods and services, either directly or in collaboration with other retailers; (4) companies that provide e-commerce\nservices, including website development and hosting, omnichannel sales, inventory and supply chain management, advertising, fulfillment, customer service,\nand payment processing; (5) companies that provide fulfillment and logistics services for themselves or for third parties, whether online or offline; (6)\ncompanies that provide information technology services or products, including on-premises or cloud-based infrastructure, tools and services relating to\nartificial intelligence, and other services; (7) companies that design, manufacture, market, or sell consumer electronics, communications, and other electronic\ndevices and services; (8) companies that sell grocery products online and in physical stores; (9) companies that provide advertising services, whether in digital\nor other formats; and (10) providers of virtual or in-person healthcare services. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our retail businesses include\nselection, price, and convenience, including fast and reliable fulfillment. Additional competitive factors for our seller and enterprise services include the\nquality, speed, and reliability of our services and tools, as well as customers\u2019 ability and willingness to change business practices. Some of our current and\npotential competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more customers, greater brand recognition, and greater control over inputs critical to our various\nbusinesses. They may secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing, pursue restrictive distribution agreements that restrict our access to\nsupply, direct consumers to their own offerings instead of ours, lock-in potential customers with restrictive terms, and devote more resources to technology,\ninfrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing. The internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, which enhances the ability of new, smaller, or\nlesser-known businesses to compete against us. Each of our businesses is also subject to rapid change and the development of new business models and the\nentry of new and well-funded competitors. Other companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions.\nIntellectual Property\nWe regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies, and similar intellectual\nproperty as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements\nwith our employees, customers, partners, and others to protect our proprietary rights. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S.\nand international domain names, trademarks, service marks, and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering\ncertain of our proprietary technology.\nSeasonality\nOur business is affected by seasonality, which historically has resulted in higher sales volume during our fourth quarter, which ends December 31.\nHuman Capital\nOur employees are critical to our mission of being Earth\u2019s most customer-centric company. As of December 31, 2024, we employed approximately\n1,556,000 full-time and part-time employees. Additionally, we use independent contractors and temporary personnel to supplement our workforce. Competition\nfor qualified personnel is intense, particularly for software engineers, computer scientists, and other technical staff, and constrained labor markets have\nincreased competition for personnel across other parts of our business.\nWe strive to be Earth\u2019s best employer. We rely on numerous and evolving initiatives to implement this objective and invent mechanisms for talent\ndevelopment, including competitive pay and benefits, flexible work arrangements, and skills training and educational programs such as Amazon Career Choice\n(education funding for eligible employees). Over 240,000 Amazon employees around the world have participated in Career Choice. We also continue to inspect\nand refine the mechanisms we use to hire, develop, evaluate, and retain our employees. In addition, safety is integral to everything we do at Amazon and we\ncontinue to invest in safety improvements such as capital improvements, new safety technology, vehicle safety controls, and engineering ergonomic solutions.\nOur safety team is dedicated to using the science of safety to solve complex problems and establish new industry best practices. We also provide mentorship\nand support resources to our employees, and have deployed numerous programs that advance employee engagement, communication, and feedback.\n4\nTable of Contents\nAvailable Information\nOur investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make\navailable on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), corporate governance\ninformation (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases.\nExecutive Officers and Directors\nThe following tables set forth certain information regarding our Executive Officers and Directors as of January 29, 2025:\nInformation About Our Executive Officers\nName Age Position\nJeffrey P.

These transactions involve risks such as:\n\u2022 disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses;\n\u2022 problems retaining key personnel;\n\u2022 additional operating losses and expenses of the businesses we acquired or in which we invested;\n\u2022 the potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets and goodwill, including as a result of acquisitions;\n\u2022 the potential impairment of customer and other relationships of the company we acquired or in which we invested or our own customers as a result of\nany integration of operations;\n\u2022 the difficulty of completing such transactions, including obtaining regulatory approvals or satisfying other closing conditions, and achieving\nanticipated benefits within expected timeframes, or at all;\n\u2022 the difficulty of incorporating acquired operations, technology, and rights into our offerings, and unanticipated expenses related to such integration;\n\u2022 the difficulty of integrating a new company\u2019s accounting, financial and sustainability reporting, management, information and data security, human\nresource, and other administrative systems to permit effective management, and the lack of control if such integration is delayed or not successfully\nimplemented;\n\u2022 losses we may incur as a result of declines in the value of an investment or as a result of incorporating an investee\u2019s financial performance into our\nfinancial results;\n\u2022 for investments in which an investee\u2019s financial performance is incorporated into our financial results, either in full or in part, or investments for\nwhich we are required to file financial statements or provide financial information, the dependence on the investee\u2019s accounting, financial and\nsustainability reporting, and similar systems, controls, and processes;\n\u2022 the difficulty of implementing at companies we acquire the controls, procedures, and policies appropriate for a larger public company;\n\u2022 the risks associated with businesses we acquire or invest in, which may differ from or be more significant than the risks our other businesses face;\n\u2022 potential unknown liabilities associated with a company we acquire or in which we invest; and\n\u2022 for foreign transactions, additional risks related to the integration of operations across different cultures and languages, and the economic, political,\nand regulatory risks associated with specific countries. The\nevents and consequences discussed in these risk factors could, in circumstances we may or may not be able to accurately predict, recognize, or control, have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, growth, reputation, prospects, financial condition, operating results (including components of our financial results),\ncash flows, liquidity, and stock price. Many of the risks discussed below also impact our customers, including third-party sellers, which could indirectly have a material adverse\neffect on us. We Could Be Harmed by Data Loss or Other Security Incidents\nBecause we collect, process, store, and transmit large amounts of data, including confidential, classified, sensitive, proprietary, and business and personal\ninformation, failure to prevent, detect, or mitigate data loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized access, or other security incidents or vulnerabilities affecting our or our\nvendors\u2019 or customers\u2019 technology, products, and systems, could: expose us or our customers to a risk of loss, disclosure, or misuse of such information;\nadversely affect our operating results; result in litigation, liability, or regulatory action (including under laws related to privacy, data use, data protection, data\nsecurity, network security, and consumer protection); deter customers or sellers from using our stores, products, and services; and otherwise harm our business\nand reputation. In addition, changes we\nmake to our current and future work environments may not meet the needs or expectations of our employees or may be perceived as less favorable compared to\nother companies\u2019 policies, which could negatively impact our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel. In addition, changes in laws and regulations applicable to employees, independent contractors, and temporary personnel could increase\nour payroll costs, decrease our operational flexibility, and negatively impact how we are able to staff our operations and supplement our workforce. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by factors, events, or\nuncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations. As a result of competition, our\nproduct and service offerings may not be successful, we may fail to gain or may lose business, and we may be required to increase our spending or lower\nprices, any of which could materially reduce our sales and profits.

    "Results": "Results of Operations\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All\nstatements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding guidance, industry prospects, or future results of operations or financial\nposition, made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward-looking. We use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends, and similar\nexpressions to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect management\u2019s current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Actual\nresults and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global\neconomic conditions and customer demand and spending, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the\ninternet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the\ntiming of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent\nto which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion,\nthe outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of\ninventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which we enter into, maintain, and develop commercial agreements, proposed and completed\nacquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. In addition, global economic and geopolitical\nconditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. These risks and uncertainties,\nas well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results or outcomes to differ significantly from management\u2019s expectations, are described in\ngreater detail in Item 1A of Part I, \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nOverview\nOur primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers. The products offered through our stores include\nmerchandise and content we have purchased for resale and products offered by third-party sellers, and we also manufacture and sell electronic devices and\nproduce media content. Generally, we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our net share of revenue\nof items sold by third-party sellers as service sales. We seek to increase unit sales across our stores, through increased product selection, across numerous\nproduct categories. We also offer other services such as compute, storage, and database offerings, fulfillment, advertising, publishing, and digital content\nsubscriptions.\nOur financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flows. Free cash flows are driven primarily by increasing operating income and\nefficiently managing accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable, and cash capital expenditures, including our decision to purchase or lease property and\nequipment. Increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs,\npartially offset by investments we make in longer-term strategic initiatives, including capital expenditures focused on improving the customer experience. To\nincrease sales of products and services, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering prices, improving availability,\noffering faster delivery and performance times, increasing selection, producing original content, increasing product categories and service offerings, expanding\nproduct information, improving ease of use, improving reliability, and earning customer trust. See \u201cResults of Operations \u2014 Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d\nbelow for additional information on our non-GAAP free cash flows financial measures.\nWe seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs. Our variable costs include product and content costs, payment\nprocessing and related transaction costs, picking, packaging, and preparing orders for shipment, transportation, customer service support, costs necessary to run\nAWS, and a portion of our marketing costs. Our fixed costs include the costs necessary to build and run our technology infrastructure; to build, enhance, and\nadd features to our online stores, web services, electronic devices, and digital offerings; and to build and optimize our fulfillment network. Variable costs\ngenerally change directly with sales volume, while fixed costs generally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs, geographic expansion, category\nexpansion, and other factors. To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct\nsourcing, increase discounts from suppliers, and reduce defects in our processes. To minimize unnecessary growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process\nefficiencies and maintain a lean culture.\nWe seek to turn inventory quickly and collect from consumers before our payments to vendors and sellers become due. Because consumers primarily use\ncredit cards in our stores, our receivables from consumers settle quickly. We expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by numerous\nfactors, including our product mix, the mix of sales by us and by third-party sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability and selection of\nproduct offerings, supply chain disruptions and resulting vendor lead times, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we\nchoose to utilize third-party fulfillment providers. We also expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors,\nincluding the mix of product sales, the mix of sales by third-party sellers, the mix\n20\nTable of Contents\nof suppliers, seasonality, and changes in payment and other terms over time, including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with\nsuppliers.\nWe expect spending in technology and infrastructure will increase over time as we add computer scientists, designers, software and hardware engineers,\nand merchandising employees. Our technology and infrastructure investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service\nofferings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology\nand infrastructure, including AWS, and expansion of new and existing product categories and service offerings, as well as in infrastructure to enhance the\ncustomer experience and improve our process efficiencies. We believe that advances in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing\npower, data storage and analytics, improved wireless connectivity, and the practical applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning, will continue to\nimprove users\u2019 experience on the internet and increase its ubiquity in people\u2019s lives. To best take advantage of these continued advances in technology, we are\ninvesting in AWS, which offers a broad set of on-demand technology services, including compute, storage, database, analytics, and machine learning, and other\nservices to developers and enterprises of all sizes. We are also investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic\ndevices as well as other initiatives including the development of a satellite network for global broadband service and autonomous vehicles for ride-hailing",

Cash outflows from financing activities\nresulted from payments of short-term debt, and other, long-term debt, finance leases, and financing obligations of $34.0 billion and $17.0 billion in 2023 and\n2024. See Item 1A of Part I, \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or\ndebt securities, obtain credit facilities, obtain finance and operating lease arrangements, enter into financing obligations, repurchase common stock, pay\ndividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the\nacquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, capital infrastructure, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity\nrequirements or cause us to secure additional financing, or issue additional equity or debt securities. Cash inflows from financing activities resulted\nfrom proceeds from short-term debt, and other and long-term-debt of $18.1 billion and $5.1 billion in 2023 and 2024. The increase in operating cash flow in 2024, compared to the prior year, was due to an\nincrease in net income (loss), excluding non-cash expenses, and changes in working capital. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many\nvariables, including variability in demand, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, customer and vendor\npayment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with cash capital expenditures, including leasehold improvements, incentives received from\nproperty and equipment vendors, proceeds from asset sales, cash outlays for\n22\nTable of Contents\nacquisitions, investments in other companies and intellectual property rights, and purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities. Cash provided by\n(used in) investing activities was $(49.8) billion and $(94.3) billion in 2023 and 2024, with the variability caused primarily by purchases, sales, and maturities\nof marketable securities and cash capital expenditures. Cash capital expenditures were $48.1 billion, and $77.7 billion in 2023 and 2024, which primarily\nreflect investments in technology infrastructure (the majority of which is to support AWS business growth) and in additional capacity to support our fulfillment\nnetwork. We expect cash capital expenditures to increase in 2025, primarily driven by investments in technology infrastructure. Cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $(15.9) billion and $(11.8) billion in 2023 and 2024. Additionally, we have purchase obligations\nand open purchase orders, including for inventory and capital expenditures, that support normal operations and are primarily due in the next twelve months. There can be no assurance that additional credit lines or\nfinancing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Cash provided by (used in) operating activities was $84.9 billion and $115.9 billion in 2023 and 2024. Our operating cash flows result primarily from\ncash received from our consumer, seller, developer, enterprise, and content creator customers, and advertisers, offset by cash payments we make for products\nand services, employee compensation, payment processing and related transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments. Cash received from our\ncustomers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales. We made cash payments, net of\nacquired cash, related to acquisition and other investment activity of $5.8 billion and $7.1 billion in 2023 and 2024. (One Medical) in 2023 with cash on hand. We had no borrowings outstanding under the two unsecured revolving credit facilities or the commercial paper programs as of December 31, 2024.

As of December 31, 2024, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries were $6.3 billion. We intend to invest\nsubstantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. taxable income is reduced by accelerated depreciation deductions and increased by the impact of capitalized research and development\nexpenses. Additionally, effective January 1, 2022, research and development expenses are required to be capitalized\nand amortized for U.S. Cash paid for U.S. As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, restricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $503 million and $3.5 billion.

These purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provisions. We believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, as well as our borrowing\narrangements, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next twelve months. However, any projections of future cash needs\nand cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, economic conditions and actions by policymaking bodies\nare contributing to changing interest rates and significant capital market volatility, which, along with any increases in our borrowing levels, could increase our\nfuture borrowing costs. Amounts held in foreign currencies were $23.5 billion and $25.5 billion as\nof December 31, 2023 and 2024. Our foreign currency balances include British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Euros, Indian Rupees, and Japanese Yen. We funded the acquisition of 1Life\nHealthcare, Inc. In Q3 2023, we invested $1.25 billion in a convertible note from Anthropic, PBC. In Q1 2024, we\ninvested $2.75 billion in a second convertible note. In Q4 2024, we entered into an agreement and invested $1.3 billion in a third convertible note, and will\ninvest an additional $2.7 billion by Q4 2025. Property and equipment acquired under finance leases was $642 million and $854 million in 2023 and 2024. in those jurisdictions in\nwhich we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts. Our U.S. U.S. tax rules provide for enhanced accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing us to expense a portion of qualified property, primarily\nequipment. These enhanced deductions are scheduled to phase out annually from 2023 through 2026. Our federal tax provision included accelerated\ndepreciation deductions for 2022, 2023, and 2024. tax purposes, which delays the deductibility of these expenses. (federal and state) and foreign income taxes (net of\nrefunds) totaled $11.2 billion and $12.3 billion for 2023 and 2024. 23\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS.

These risks and uncertainties,\nas well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results or outcomes to differ significantly from management\u2019s expectations, are described in\ngreater detail in Item 1A of Part I, \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nOverview\nOur primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers. We expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by numerous\nfactors, including our product mix, the mix of sales by us and by third-party sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability and selection of\nproduct offerings, supply chain disruptions and resulting vendor lead times, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we\nchoose to utilize third-party fulfillment providers. We also expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors,\nincluding the mix of product sales, the mix of sales by third-party sellers, the mix\n20\nTable of Contents\nof suppliers, seasonality, and changes in payment and other terms over time, including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with\nsuppliers. We expect spending in technology and infrastructure will increase over time as we add computer scientists, designers, software and hardware engineers,\nand merchandising employees. Forward-Looking Statements\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual\nresults and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global\neconomic conditions and customer demand and spending, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the\ninternet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the\ntiming of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent\nto which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion,\nthe outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of\ninventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which we enter into, maintain, and develop commercial agreements, proposed and completed\nacquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. In addition, global economic and geopolitical\nconditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. The products offered through our stores include\nmerchandise and content we have purchased for resale and products offered by third-party sellers, and we also manufacture and sell electronic devices and\nproduce media content. Generally, we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our net share of revenue\nof items sold by third-party sellers as service sales. We seek to increase unit sales across our stores, through increased product selection, across numerous\nproduct categories. We also offer other services such as compute, storage, and database offerings, fulfillment, advertising, publishing, and digital content\nsubscriptions. Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flows. Free cash flows are driven primarily by increasing operating income and\nefficiently managing accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable, and cash capital expenditures, including our decision to purchase or lease property and\nequipment. Increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs,\npartially offset by investments we make in longer-term strategic initiatives, including capital expenditures focused on improving the customer experience. To\nincrease sales of products and services, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering prices, improving availability,\noffering faster delivery and performance times, increasing selection, producing original content, increasing product categories and service offerings, expanding\nproduct information, improving ease of use, improving reliability, and earning customer trust. See \u201cResults of Operations \u2014 Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d\nbelow for additional information on our non-GAAP free cash flows financial measures. We seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs. Our variable costs include product and content costs, payment\nprocessing and related transaction costs, picking, packaging, and preparing orders for shipment, transportation, customer service support, costs necessary to run\nAWS, and a portion of our marketing costs. Our fixed costs include the costs necessary to build and run our technology infrastructure; to build, enhance, and\nadd features to our online stores, web services, electronic devices, and digital offerings; and to build and optimize our fulfillment network. Variable costs\ngenerally change directly with sales volume, while fixed costs generally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs, geographic expansion, category\nexpansion, and other factors. To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct\nsourcing, increase discounts from suppliers, and reduce defects in our processes. To minimize unnecessary growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process\nefficiencies and maintain a lean culture. We seek to turn inventory quickly and collect from consumers before our payments to vendors and sellers become due. Because consumers primarily use\ncredit cards in our stores, our receivables from consumers settle quickly. Our technology and infrastructure investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service\nofferings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology\nand infrastructure, including AWS, and expansion of new and existing product categories and service offerings, as well as in infrastructure to enhance the\ncustomer experience and improve our process efficiencies. We believe that advances in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing\npower, data storage and analytics, improved wireless connectivity, and the practical applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning, will continue to\nimprove users\u2019 experience on the internet and increase its ubiquity in people\u2019s lives. To best take advantage of these continued advances in technology, we are\ninvesting in AWS, which offers a broad set of on-demand technology services, including compute, storage, database, analytics, and machine learning, and other\nservices to developers and enterprises of all sizes. We are also investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic\ndevices as well as other initiatives including the development of a satellite network for global broadband service and autonomous vehicles for ride-hailing\nservices. We seek to"
