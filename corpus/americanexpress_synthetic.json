    "Business": "BUSINESS\nOverview\nAmerican Express is a globally integrated payments company with card-issuing, merchant-acquiring and card network businesses that offer products and\nservices to a broad range of customers, including consumers, small businesses, mid-sized companies and large corporations around the world.\nOur range of products and services includes:\n\u2022 Credit card, charge card, banking and other payment and financing products\n\u2022 Merchant acquisition and processing, servicing and settlement, fraud prevention, and point-of-sale marketing and information products and services\n\u2022 Network services\n\u2022 Travel and lifestyle services\n\u2022 Expense management products and services\n\u2022 Other services, such as the design and operation of customer loyalty programs\nThese products and services are offered through various channels, including mobile and online applications, affiliate marketing, customer referral programs,\nthird-party service providers and business partners, in-house sales teams, direct mail, telephone and direct response advertising.\nWe were founded in 1850 as a joint stock association and were incorporated in 1965 as a New York corporation. American Express Company and its principal\noperating subsidiary, American Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc. (TRS), are bank holding companies under the Bank Holding Company Act of\n1956, as amended (the BHC Act), subject to supervision and examination by The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve).\nWe principally engage in businesses comprising four reportable operating segments: U.S. Consumer Services (USCS), Commercial Services (CS), International\nCard Services (ICS) and Global Merchant and Network Services (GMNS). Corporate functions and certain other businesses are included in Corporate & Other.\nOur businesses function together to form our end-to-end integrated payments platform, which we believe is a differentiator that underpins our business model.\nFor further information about our reportable operating segments, see \u201cBusiness Segment Results of Operations\u201d under \u201cMD&A.\u201d\n1\nTable of Contents\nOur Integrated Payments Platform and Technology\nThrough our card-issuing, merchant-acquiring and card network businesses, we are able to connect participants and provide differentiated value across the\ncommerce path. We maintain direct relationships with Card Members (as a card issuer) and merchants (as an acquirer), which provides us with access to\ninformation at both ends of the card transaction, distinguishing our integrated payments platform from the bankcard networks. Through contractual\nrelationships, we also obtain information from third-party card issuers, merchant acquirers, aggregators and processors with whom we do business.\nOur integrated payments platform and the systems and infrastructure that underlie it provide us with data and analytics, while maintaining our commitment to\nrespect Card Member preferences and protect Card Member and merchant data in compliance with applicable policies and legal requirements. Our models and\nanalytical tools help us reduce fraud and underwrite risk, such as in determinations regarding the extension of credit. We also leverage our technology to\nprovide differentiated value to customers, such as special offers and benefits to Card Members and targeted marketing and other information services for\nmerchants and partners, as well as to develop and improve our service capabilities to continue to deliver a high-quality customer experience.\nCard Issuing Businesses\nWe are a leader in providing general purpose credit and charge cards to consumers, small businesses, mid-sized companies and large corporations. We offer a\nbroad set of card products, rewards and services to this premium consumer and broad commercial customer base, in the United States and internationally,\nthrough our USCS, CS and ICS reportable operating segments. We focus on differentiating American Express Membership through premium products, lifestyle\nservices for consumers and business-centric solutions for our commercial customers, and benefits for our Card Members that we co-create and co-fund with\nour business partners. We believe the many benefits that come with American Express Membership build a strong, emotional connection with our brand across\ngenerations and geographies.\nWe acquire and retain high-spending, engaged and creditworthy Card Members by:\n\u2022 Designing innovative credit, charge and debit card products and payment and lending solutions that appeal to our target customer base and meet\ntheir spending and borrowing needs\n\u2022 Using incentives to drive spending on our various card products and increase customer engagement, including our Membership Rewards  and\nAmex Offers  programs, cash-back reward features, statement credits for purchases with partners, interest rates offered on deposits and\nparticipation in loyalty programs sponsored by our cobrand and other partners\n\u2022 Providing digital and mobile services and an array of benefits and experiences across card products, such as lounge access, dining experiences\nand other travel and lifestyle benefits\n\u2022 Creating world-class service experiences by delivering exceptional customer care\n\u2022 Developing a wide range of partner relationships, including designing, cobranding and distributing certain of our cards and providing benefits and\nservices to our Card Members\nWe have a number of products that complement our card products, such as our business checking and consumer rewards checking account products, expense\nmanagement and business-to-business (B2B) payment products and other non-card payment and financing products. Our complementary products also include\ndigital capabilities, such as our Business Blueprint digital cash flow management hub and our Resy  dining platform, which we are enhancing through our\nacquisitions in 2024 of Tock, a reservation, table and event management technology provider and Rooam, a technology company that powers systems used by\nrestaurants and entertainment venues.\nWe are focused on enhancing the value propositions of our products to increase engagement with existing customers and attract new customers, including\nMillennial and Gen Z consumers as well as customers internationally. Jurisdictions that represent a significant portion of our billed business outside of the\nUnited States include the United Kingdom (UK), the European Union (EU), Australia, Japan, Canada and Mexico.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, worldwide billed business (spending on American Express cards issued by us) was $1,551 billion and as of December\n31, 2024, we had 83.6 million proprietary cards-in-force worldwide.\n\u00ae\n\u2122\n\u00ae\n2\nTable of Contents\nMerchant Acquiring Business\nOur GMNS reportable operating segment builds and manages relationships with millions of merchants around the world that choose to accept American\nExpress cards. This includes signing new merchants to accept our cards, agreeing on the discount rate (a fee charged to the merchant for accepting our cards)\nand handling servicing for merchants. We also build and maintain relationships with merchant acquirers, aggregators and processors to manage aspects of our\nmerchant services business. For example, through our OptBlue  merchant-acquiring program, third-party processors contract directly with small merchants for\ncard acceptance on our network and determine merchant pricing. We continue to grow merchant acceptance of American Express cards around the world and\nwork with merchant partners so that our Card Members are warmly welcomed and encouraged to spend in the millions of places where their American Express\ncards are accepted. We also seek to drive greater usage of the American Express network by deepening merchant engagement and increasing Card Member\nawareness through initiatives such as our Shop Small  campaigns and expanding our payment options such as through debit and B2B capabilities.\nGMNS also provides fraud-prevention tools, marketing solutions, data analytics and other programs and services to merchants and other partners that leverage\nthe capabilities of our integrated payments platform.\nCard Network Business\nWe operate a payments network through which we establish and maintain relationships with third-party banks and other institutions in approximately 120\ncountries and territories, licensing the American Express brand and extending the reach of our global network. These network partners are licensed to issue\nlocal currency American Express-branded cards in their countries and/or serve as the merchant acquirer for local merchants on our network.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, worldwide network services processed volume (spending on American Express cards issued by third parties) was\n$213.9 billion and as of December 31, 2024, we had 62.8 million cards-in-force issued by third parties worldwide.\nDiverse Customer Base and Global Footprint\nThe following chart provides a summary of our diverse set of customers and broad geographic footprint based on worldwide network volumes:\n\u00ae\n\u00ae\n3\nTable of Contents\nPartners and Relationships\nOur integrated payments platform allows us to work with a range of business partners, and our partners in return help drive the scale and relevance of the\nplatform.\nThere are many examples of how we work with partners, including: issuing cards under cobrand arrangements with other corporations and institutions (e.g.,\nDelta Air Lines (Delta), Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Marriott International and British Airways); providing greater value to our Card Members (e.g., Amex\nOffers and statement credits for purchases with partners); offering innovative ways for our Card Members to earn and use points with our merchants (e.g., Pay\nwith Points at Amazon.com); expanding merchant acceptance with third-party acquirers and processors (e.g., OptBlue partners); operating through joint\nventures in certain jurisdictions (e.g., in China, the Middle East and Switzerland); developing new capabilities and features",
    "Risk Factors": "Our ability to obtain financing in the debt capital markets for unsecured term debt and asset securitizations is dependent on financial market conditions.Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility across the financial markets, as well as adverse developments affecting our competitors and the financial industrygenerally, could negatively impact market liquidity and limit our access to funding required to operate our business. The broader consequences remain uncertain, but geopolitical conditions mayadversely affect macroeconomic conditions and our business in a number of ways, including regional\n23\nTable of Contents\ninstability, increased prevalence and sophistication of cyberattacks, potential retaliatory action against companies such as us, further sanctions activity andrelated regulatory scrutiny, increased inflation, further increases or fluctuations in commodity and energy prices, decreases in global travel and furtherdisruptions to the global supply chain. Similarly, we are exposed to risk from bankruptcies, liquidations, insolvencies, financial distress, restructurings, consolidations, operational outages,cybersecurity incidents and other similar events that may occur in any industry representing a significant portion of our billed business, which could negativelyimpact particular card products and services (and volumes generally) and our financial condition and results of operations. We face continued intense competitive pressure that may materially impact the prices we charge for accepting our cards for payment, as well as the risk oflosing merchant relationships, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. Adversedevelopments with respect to our industry, including the creation and implementation of new merchant categories codes, may also negatively impact ourreputation, or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny or litigation against us. Joint ventures and other partnerships orminority investments operating in foreign jurisdictions may also face risks from adverse regulatory actions, which could adversely affect their operations or ourinvestment. Information, operational or cybersecurity incidents, fraudulent activity and other actual or perceived failures to maintain confidentiality, integrity, availabilityof services and data, privacy and/or security has led to increased regulatory scrutiny and may lead to regulatory investigations and intervention (such asmandatory card reissuance), consent decrees, increased litigation (including class action litigation), response costs (including notification and remediationcosts), fines, negative assessments of us and our subsidiaries by banking regulators and rating agencies, reputational and financial damage to our brand,negative impacts to our partner relationships, and reduced usage of our products and services, all of which could have a material adverse impact on ourbusiness. An inability to meet regulatory expectations regarding ourcompliance with applicable capital adequacy and liquidity rules or supervisory expectations regarding capital and liquidity risk management capabilities andpractices may also negatively impact the assessment of us and AENB by federal banking regulators. Market risk includes the loss in value of portfolios and financial instruments due to adverse changes in market variables, which could negatively impact ourfinancial condition. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently\nbelieve to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. Several countries are considering or have implemented tariffs or othertrade barriers or restrictions, as well as other measures affecting cross-border commerce and the flow of information, which could have broad economicconsequences, impact global supply chains and negatively affect our business, customers and partners. We face intense competition for partner relationships, which could result in a loss or renegotiation of these arrangements that could have a materialadverse impact on our business and results of operations. The loss of exclusivity arrangements with business partners, the loss of the partner relationship altogether (whether by non-renewal at the end of the contractperiod, such as the end of our relationship with Costco in the United States in 2016, or as the result of a merger, legal or regulatory action or otherwise) or therenegotiation of existing partnerships with terms that are significantly worse for us could have a material adverse impact on our business and results ofoperations. To the extent any of our partners fail to effectivelypromote and support our products, experience a slowdown in their business, operational disruptions, reputational issues or loss of consumer confidence, or areotherwise unable to meet our expectations or those of their other stakeholders, our business may be materially negatively impacted. If such operations are interrupted, suspended,terminated or otherwise experience further issues in the future, it could further negatively impact our customers\u2019 experience, result in additional costs, litigationand regulatory action, and harm our business and reputation. In addition, the regulatoryenvironment and differentiated payment models and technologies from non-traditional players in the alternative payments space could pose challenges to ourtraditional payment model and adversely impact our merchant discount rates. We may not succeed in maintaining merchant discount rates or offsetting the impact of declining merchant discount rates, for the reasonsdiscussed above and others, which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability, and therefore our ability to invest in innovation and invalue-added services for merchants, business partners and Card Members. Adverse consequences of artificial intelligence and machine learning remain uncertain butcould include flaws in the decisions, predictions, outputs or analysis such technologies produce and subjecting us to competitive harm, legal liability,heightened regulatory scrutiny and brand or reputational harm. In addition, our adoption of newtechnologies and our introduction of new products and services may increase operational complexity and risk, and expose us to new or enhanced risks,particularly in areas where we have less experience or our existing governance and control systems may be insufficient, which could require us to makesubstantial expenditures or subject us to legal liability, heightened regulatory scrutiny and brand or reputational harm. We are subject to varied cybersecurity regulations and incident reportingrequirements, which could require us to disclose incidents that may not have been resolved or fully investigated at the time of disclosure, leading to customerconfusion, regulatory scrutiny and negative publicity and exacerbating risks related to the incident itself. Successful cyberattacks, data breaches, disruptions or other incidents related to the actual or perceived failures to maintain confidentiality, integrity, availabilityof services and data, privacy and/or security at other large financial institutions, large retailers, travel and hospitality companies, government agencies or othermarket participants, whether or not we are impacted, could lead to a general loss of customer confidence that could negatively affect us, including harming themarket perception of the effectiveness of our security measures or harming the reputation of the financial system in general, which could result in reduced useof our products and services. If we fail to satisfy regulatory requirements or maintain our financial holding company status, our financial condition and results of operations could beadversely affected, and we may be restricted in our ability to take certain capital actions (such as declaring dividends or repurchasing outstanding shares) orengage in certain business activities or acquisitions, which could compromise our competitive position. Even if we were notrequired to change our merchant agreements, changes in Visa\u2019s and Mastercard\u2019s policies or practices as a result of legal proceedings, lawsuit settlements orregulatory actions pending against them could result in changes to our business practices and materially and adversely impact our profitability. Suchdisruptions or other events could interrupt or compromise the quality of our services to customers, impact the confidentiality, integrity, availability and securityof our data, lead to fraudulent transactions on our cards or other products, impact our business, cause brand or reputational damage, and lead to costs associatedwith responding to such a disruption, including notification and remediation costs, costs to switch service providers or move operations in house, regulatoryinvestigations and fines and increased regulatory oversight and litigation. Jurisdictions may also make changes related to the tax treatment of card transactions, such as imposing taxes on Card Member rewards or prohibitinginterchange fees on sales tax, which could decrease the value we provide to customers and adversely impact our business. Ourability to assess creditworthiness may be impaired as a result of changes in our underwriting practices or if the criteria or models we use to manage our creditrisk prove inaccurate in predicting future losses, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations. Further, our pricing strategies, particularly for new lending features and non-card lending products, may notoffset the negative impact on profitability caused by increases in delinquencies and losses; thus any material increases in delinquencies and losses beyond ourcurrent estimates could have a material adverse impact on us. Strategic & Business, Reputational and Country Risks\nBusiness and economic conditions are a major driver of our results of operations and difficult conditions in the business and economic environment maymaterially adversely affect our business.",

Cash Flows from Financing Activities\nOur cash flows from financing activities primarily include changes in customer deposits, long-term debt and short-term borrowings, as well as dividend\npayments and share repurchases. In both 2024 and 2023, the net cash provided by financing activities was primarily driven by growth in customer deposits and net proceeds from long-term\ndebt, partially offset by share repurchases and dividend payments. liquidity and capital resources. The ERM policy defines and governs risk governance, risk oversight and risk appetite, including credit risk (at both the\nindividual and institutional levels), operational risk (e.g., operations and process, legal, conduct, third-party, information technology, information security, data\nmanagement, privacy and people risks), compliance risk, reputational risk, market risk, funding and liquidity risk, model risk, strategic and business risk and\ncountry risk. The Risk Committee also provides oversight of our compliance with Regulatory capital and liquidity standards, and our Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment\nProcess, including the CCAR submissions. In 2024, the net cash provided by operating activities was driven by cash generated from net income for the period, partially offset by lower net operating\nliabilities, primarily driven by lower book overdrafts due to timing differences arising in the ordinary course of business. In 2023, the net cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by cash generated from net income for the period and higher net operating\nliabilities, primarily driven by higher book overdrafts due to timing differences arising in the ordinary course of business and higher accounts payable to\nmerchants. Cash Flows from Investing Activities\nOur cash flows from investing activities primarily include changes in loans and Card Member receivables, as well as changes in our available-for-sale\ninvestment securities portfolio. In both 2024 and 2023, the net cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by higher Loans and Card Member receivables outstanding, partially\noffset by net maturities of investment securities. 72\nTable of Contents\nRISK MANAGEMENT\nGOVERNANCE\nRisk management is overseen by our Board of Directors through three Board committees: the Risk Committee, the Audit and Compliance Committee, and the\nCompensation and Benefits Committee. Each committee consists entirely of independent directors and provides regular reports to the full Board regarding\nmatters reviewed at their committee. The committees meet regularly in private sessions with our Chief Risk Officer, the Chief Compliance Officer, the Chief\nAudit Executive and other senior management with regard to our risk management processes, risk profile and performance, controls, talent and capabilities. The Board monitors the \u201ctone at the top,\u201d our risk culture, and oversees emerging and strategic risks. We use our comprehensive Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program to identify, aggregate, monitor, measure, report and manage risks. The program also\ndefines our risk appetite, governance, culture and capabilities. The implementation and execution of the ERM program is headed by our Chief Risk Officer. The Risk Committee reviews and concurs with the appointment, replacement, performance and compensation of our Chief Risk Officer and receives regular\nupdates from the Chief Risk Officer on key risks and exposures. The Risk Committee of our Board of Directors provides oversight of our ERM framework, processes and methodologies. The Risk Committee approves our\nERM and select other risk policies. The ERM policy also guides the monitoring of emerging risks, as appropriate. Risk appetite defines the authorized risk limits to control exposures\nwithin our risk capacity and risk tolerance, including stressed forward-looking scenarios. In addition, it establishes principles for risk taking in the aggregate\nand for each risk type, and is supported by a comprehensive system for monitoring performance (including limits and escalation triggers) and assessing control\nprograms. On an ongoing basis, the Risk Committee reviews our risk profile against the tolerances specified in the Risk Appetite Framework, including\nsignificant risk exposures, risk trends in our portfolios and major risk concentrations. The Audit and Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors reviews and approves compliance policies, which include our Compliance Risk Tolerance\nStatement. In addition, the Audit and Compliance Committee reviews the effectiveness of our Corporate-wide Compliance Risk Management Program.

The Audit and Compliance Committee provides oversight of our Internal Audit Group. The Audit and Compliance Committee reviews and concurs with the\nappointment, replacement, performance and compensation of our Chief Audit Executive, who reports to the Audit and Compliance Committee, and approves\nInternal Audit\u2019s annual audit plan, charter, policies, budget and staffing levels, and overall risk assessment methodology. The Audit and Compliance Committee\nalso receives regular updates on the audit plan\u2019s status and results, including significant reports issued by Internal Audit and the status of our corrective actions. The Compensation and Benefits Committee of our Board of Directors works with the Chief Risk Officer to ensure our overall compensation programs, as well\nas those covering our risk-taking employees, appropriately balance risk with business incentives and that business performance is achieved without taking\nimprudent or excessive risk. Our Chief Risk Officer is actively involved in setting risk goals for the Company. Our Chief Risk Officer also reviews the risk\nprofiles of each business unit and, in conjunction with the Chief Audit Executive, provides input into performance evaluation through the Risk Performance\nProgram. The Chief Risk Officer meets with the Compensation and Benefits Committee and attests whether performance goals and results have been achieved\nwithout taking imprudent risks.

The amount of short-term borrowings issued in the future will depend on our funding strategy, our needs and market conditions. Downgrades in the ratings of our unsecured debt or asset securitization program securities could result in higher funding costs, as well as higher fees related toborrowings under our unused credit facilities. Declines in credit ratings could also reduce our borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitizationcapital markets. We believe our funding mix, including the proportion of U.S. direct deposits insured by the FDIC to total funding, should reduce the impactthat credit rating downgrades would have on our funding capacity and costs. In August, 2023, the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would require covered bank holding companies such asAmerican Express Company to issue and maintain minimum amounts of eligible external long-term debt and certain insured depository institutions such asAENB to issue and maintain minimum amounts of eligible internal long-term debt. See \u201cSupervision and Regulation \u2014 Capital and Liquidity Regulation\u201dunder \u201cBusiness\u201d for more information. DEPOSIT PROGRAMS\nWe offer deposits within our U.S. bank subsidiary, AENB. These funds are currently insured up to an amount that is at least $250,000 per depositor, perownership category through the FDIC; as of December 31, 2024, approximately 92 percent of these deposits were insured. Our ability to obtain deposit fundingand offer competitive interest rates is dependent on, among other factors, the capital level of AENB. The direct deposit program offered by AENB is ourprimary deposit product channel, which makes FDIC-insured high-yield savings account, certificates of deposit (CDs), business checking and consumerrewards checking account products available directly to customers. As of December 31, 2024, our direct deposit program had approximately 3.3 millionaccounts. AENB also sources deposits through third-party distribution channels as needed to meet our overall funding objectives. CDs carry stated maturitieswhile high-yield savings account, checking account and third-party sweep deposit products do not. We manage the duration of our maturing obligations,including CDs, to reduce concentration and refinancing risk. As of December 31, 2024, we had $139.4 billion in deposits. Refer to Note 7 to the \u201cConsolidated Financial Statements\u201d for a further description of thesedeposits and scheduled maturities of certificates of deposits. The following table sets forth the average interest rates we paid on different types of deposits during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.Changes in the average interest rate we paid on our deposits were primarily due to the impact of higher market interest rates offered for retail deposits.

Our short-term funding programs are used primarily to fund working capital needs, such as managing seasonal variations in receivables\nbalances. We had no\ncommercial paper outstanding at any point during 2024. Refer to Note 8 to the \u201cConsolidated Financial Statements\u201d for a further description of these\nborrowings. LONG-TERM DEBT AND ASSET SECURITIZATION PROGRAMS\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $49.7 billion in long-term debt outstanding, including unsecured debt and asset-backed securities. Refer to Note 8 to the\n\u201cConsolidated Financial Statements\u201d for a further description of these borrowings and scheduled maturities of long-term debt obligations. We periodically securitize Card Member loans and receivables arising from our U.S. card business, as the securitization market provides us with cost-effective\nfunding. Securitization of Card Member loans and receivables is accomplished through the transfer of those assets to a trust, which in turn issues securities\ncollateralized by the transferred assets to third-party investors. The proceeds from issuance are distributed to us, through our wholly owned subsidiaries, as\nconsideration for the transferred assets. Refer to Note 5 to the \u201cConsolidated Financial Statements\u201d for a further description of our asset securitizations.

These include, but are not limited to, an event where we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a\nsubstantial weakening in economic conditions. Our liquidity management strategy includes a number of elements, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022 Maintaining diversified funding sources (refer to \u201cFunding Strategy\u201d above for more details);\n\u2022 Maintaining unencumbered liquid assets and off-balance sheet liquidity sources;\n\u2022 Projecting cash inflows and outflows under a variety of economic and market scenarios; and\n\u2022 Establishing clear objectives for liquidity risk management, including compliance with regulatory requirements. We seek to maintain access to a diverse set of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet liquidity sources, including cash and other liquid assets, secured\nborrowing facilities and a committed bank credit facility. Through our U.S. bank subsidiary, AENB, we have also pledged collateral eligible for use at the\nFederal Reserve\u2019s discount window. The amount and type of liquidity resources we maintain can vary over time, based upon the results of stress scenarios required under the Dodd-Frank Wall\nStreet Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as well as additional stress scenarios required und"
