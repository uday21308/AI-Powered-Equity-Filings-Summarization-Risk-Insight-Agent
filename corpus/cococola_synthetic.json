    "Business": "Business\u201d of this report. Changes in applicable laws or regulations or evolvinginterpretations thereof, changes in enforcement priorities of regulators, and differing or competing regulations and standards across the markets where our products or rawmaterials are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, have in the past resulted in, and could continue to result in, higher compliance costs, higher capital expenditures andhigher production costs, or make it necessary for us to reformulate certain of our products, resulting in adverse effects on our business. In addition, increased or additionalregulations to limit and/or report carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change; to discourage the use of plastic materials,including regulations relating to recovery and/or disposal of plastic bottles and other packaging materials due to environmental concerns; to limit or impose additional costs oncommercial water use due to local water scarcity concerns; or to address wastewater discharge to protect local bodies of water, have in the past and could continue to result inincreased compliance costs, capital expenditures and other financial obligations for us and our bottling partners, which could affect our profitability, or may impede theproduction, distribution, marketing and sale of our products, which could affect our net operating revenues. The legal and regulatory landscape for certain new technologies,such as artificial intelligence, is uncertain and evolving, and our compliance obligations could increase our costs or limit how we may use these technologies. Failure to complywith various laws and regulations (or allegations thereof), such as U.S. trade sanctions, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Office of Foreign Assets Control tradesanction regulations and anti-boycott regulations; antitrust and competition laws; anti-modern slavery laws; anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws; data privacy laws, includingthe European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation and China\u2019s Personal Information Protection Law; tax laws and regulations; and a variety of other applicable local,national and multinational regulations and laws, could result in litigation or criminal or civil enforcement actions, including voluntary and involuntary document requests, theassessment of damages, the imposition of penalties, the suspension of production or distribution, costly changes to equipment or processes due to required corrective action, orthe cessation or interruption of operations at our or our bottling partners\u2019 facilities, as well as damage to our or our bottling partners\u2019 image and reputation, all of which couldharm our or our bottling partners\u2019 profitability.\nRISKS RELATED TO FINANCE, ACCOUNTING AND INVESTMENTS\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe earn revenues, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using many currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In 2024, we derived $28.7 billion of net operatingrevenues from operations outside the United States. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues, income andexpenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in thevalue of the U.S. dollar against other currencies affect our net operating revenues, operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies.Global events, including political instability, international conflicts, trade disputes, economic sanctions, inflation, increasing interest rates and emerging market volatility, andthe resulting uncertainties, may cause currencies to fluctuate in relation to the U.S. dollar. Due to the geographic diversity of our operations, weakness in some currencies maybe offset by strength in other currencies over time. We also use derivative financial instruments to further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency exchange ratefluctuations. However, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies or the currencies of largedeveloping countries, could materially affect our financial results.\n21\nIf interest rates increase, our net income could be negatively affected.\nWe maintain levels of debt that we consider prudent based on our cash flows, interest coverage ratio and percentage of debt to capital. We use debt financing to lower our costof capital, which increases our return on shareowners\u2019 equity. This exposes us to adverse changes in interest rates. When and to the extent appropriate, we use derivativefinancial instruments to reduce our exposure to interest rate risks. However, our financial risk management program may not be successful in reducing the risks inherent inexposures to interest rate fluctuations. Our interest expense may also be affected by our credit ratings. In assessing our credit strength, credit rating agencies consider our capitalstructure and financial policies as well as the consolidated balance sheet and other financial information of the Company. In addition, some credit rating agencies also considerfinancial information of certain of our major bottling partners. It is our expectation that the credit rating agencies will continue using this methodology. If our credit ratingswere to be downgraded as a result of changes in our capital structure; our major bottling partners\u2019 financial performance; changes in the credit rating agencies\u2019 methodology inassessing our credit strength; the credit agencies\u2019 perception of the impact of credit market conditions on our or our major bottling partners\u2019 current or future financialperformance and financial condition; or for any other reason, our cost of borrowing could increase. Additionally, if the credit ratings of certain bottling partners in which wehave equity method investments were to be downgraded, such bottling partners\u2019 interest expense could increase, which would reduce our equity income.\nIf we are unable to achieve our overall long-term growth objectives, the value of an investment in our Company could be negatively affected.\nWe have established and publicly announced certain long-term growth objectives. These objectives are based on, among other things, our evaluation of our growth prospects,which are generally driven by the sales potential of our many beverage products, some of which are more profitable than others, and on an assessment of the potential price andproduct mix. We may not be able to realize the sales potential and the price and product mix necessary to achieve our long-term growth objectives.\nDefault by or failure of one or more of our counterparty financial institutions could cause us to incur significant losses.\nAs part of our hedging activities, we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments, including forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, optioncontracts, collars and swaps, with various financial institutions. In addition, we have significant amounts of cash, cash equivalents and other investments on deposit or inaccounts with banks or other financial institutions in the United States and abroad. As a result, we are exposed to the risk of default by or failure of counterparty financialinstitutions. The risk of counterparty default or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets. If one of ourcounterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or to retrieve our assets that are deposited or held inaccounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterparty\u2019s liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. In the event ofdefault by or failure of one or more of our counterparties, we could incur significant losses, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be required to recognize impairment charges that could materially affect our financial results.\nWe assess our noncurrent assets, including trademarks, goodwill and other intangible assets, equity method investments and other long-lived assets, as and when required byaccounting principles generally accepted in the United States to determine whether they are impaired and, if they are, we record appropriate impairment charges. Our equitymethod investees also perform similar recoverability and impairment tests, and we record our proportionate share of impairment charges recorded by them adjusted, asappropriate, for the impact of items such as basis differences, deferred taxes and deferred gains. We have recorded in the past, and we may be required to record in the future,significant impairment charges or our proportionate share of significant impairment charges recorded by equity method investees in the future and, if we do so, our net incomecould be materially adversely affected.\nRISKS RELATED TO CYBERSECURITY AND DATA PRIVACY\nIf we are unable to protect our information systems against service interruption, misappropriation of data or cybersecurity incidents, our operations could be disrupted, wemay suffer financial losses and our reputation may be damaged.\nWe rely on computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets (\u201cinformation systems\u201d), including the Internet and third-party hosted services, to support avariety of business processes and activities, including procurement and supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing and collection of payments, employee processes,consumer marketing, mergers and acquisitions, and research and development. We use information systems to process financial information and results of operations forinternal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial ",
    "Risk Factors": "While it is not possible to define all categories of material information, examples of material information include:\n\u2022 a significant merger, joint venture, acquisition, or disposition involving the Company;\n\u2022 earnings or volume results;\n\u2022 an extraordinary item for accounting purposes;\n\u2022 a change in dividend policy;\n\u2022 expansion or reduction of operations or business disruptions;\n\u2022 a cybersecurity incident or risk (including vulnerabilities and breaches) that may adversely impact the Company\u2019s business,reputation or share value;\n\u2022 significant developments regarding customers or suppliers;\n\u2022 development of a significant new product, process or service;\n\u2022 changes in the Company\u2019s pricing or cost structure;\n\u2022 pending regulatory action;\n\u2022 significant litigation or governmental action;\n\u2022 changes in auditors or auditor notification that the Company may no longer rely on an audit report;\n\u2022 a change in control of the Company or a change in senior management; or\n2\n\u2022 other notable transactions, events or developments outside the ordinary course of business. These changes in market conditions may adversely impact the Company\u2019s financialperformance and are referred to as \u201cmarket risks.\u201d When deemed appropriate, our Company uses derivatives as a risk management tool to mitigate the potential impact ofcertain market risks. As these factors are often interdependent and may not change in isolation, we do not believe it is practicable or meaningful to present theimpact of changing a single factor. A deterioration of macroeconomic conditions may not only negatively impact the estimated operating cash flows used inour cash flow models but may also negatively impact other assumptions used in our analyses, including, but not limited to, the discount rates. Additionally, theCompany would likely be subject to significant additional liabilities for subsequent years, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial position,results of operations and cash flows. Factors we consider when determining useful lives include the contractual term of any agreement related to the asset, the historical performance of the asset,the Company\u2019s long-term strategy for using the asset, any laws or other local regulations which could impact the useful life of the asset, and other economic factors, includingcompetition and specific market conditions. In that event, the Company would not receive a refund of the applicable portion orall of the $6.0 billion it paid in response to the IRS invoices issued in September 2024 and the related accrued interest receivable of $103 million as of December 31, 2024.Additionally, the Company would likely be subject to significant additional liabilities for subsequent years, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019sfinancial position, results of operations and cash flows.

The variability of these factors\n39\ndepends on a number of conditions, and thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period. The total futureimpairment charges we may be required to record could be material. The ability to accurately predict future cash flows, especially in emerging and developing markets, may impact the determination of fair value. The ability toaccurately predict future cash flows, especially in emerging and developing markets, may impact the determination of fair value. Changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of ourpension obligations and our net periodic pension cost or income. A number of years may elapse before a particular uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved. In addition to these items, the impact of unit case volume from certain joint ventures in whichthe Company has an ownership interest, but to which the Company does not sell concentrates, syrups, source waters or powders/minerals, may give rise to differences betweenunit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates. The following table illustrates, on a percentage basis, the estimated impact of the factors resulting in the increase (decrease) in net operating revenues on a consolidated basisand for each of our operating segments:\nPercent Change 2024 versus 2023\nVolume Price, Product &Geographic MixForeign Currency ExchangeRate Fluctuations Acquisitions &Divestitures Total\nConsolidated 2 % 11 % (5)% (4)% 3 %\nEurope, Middle East & Africa (1) 17 (16) \u2014 1 Latin America 3 21 (14) \u2014 11 North America 1 10 \u2014 \u2014 11 Asia Pacific 2 2 (3) \u2014 2 Global Ventures 4 (3) 2 \u2014 2 Bottling Investments 5 5 (2) (28) (21)\nNote: Certain rows may not add due to rounding. Thedecision of whether we decide to pursue the renewal of these grants and the impact of the grants going forward is dependent on various factors. Based on current tax laws, including the impact of several countries enacting global minimum tax regulations, the Company\u2019s effective tax rate in 2025 is expected to beapproximately 20.8% before considering the potential impact of any significant operating and nonoperating items that may affect our effective tax rate. Certain financial institutions offer a voluntary supply chain finance program which enables oursuppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their receivables from the Company to these financial institutions on a non-recourse basis at a rate that leverages our credit rating andthus may be more beneficial to them. These items were partially offset by strong cashoperating results, the transfer of surplus international plan assets from pension trusts to general assets of the Company, payments in the prior year resulting from the buildup ofinventory to manage potential supply chain disruptions, increased dividend payments from our equity method investees, and $167 million of the $275 million milestonepayment for fairlife in the prior year.
