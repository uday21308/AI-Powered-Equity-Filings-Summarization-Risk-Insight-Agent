The Company\u2019s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China,Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and\nAfrica. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia, New Zealand and those Asian countries notincluded in the Company\u2019s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services,\neach one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company\u2019s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of eachgeographic region.\nMarkets and Distribution\nThe Company\u2019s customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government markets. The Company sells itsproducts and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. TheCompany sells its services in the same markets through its various service platforms. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such\nas third-party cellular network carriers and other resellers, for the sale of its products and certain of its services. During 2025, the Company\u2019s net sales throughits direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 40% and 60%, respectively, of total net sales.\nCompetition\nThe markets for the Company\u2019s products and services are highly competitive and are characterized by aggressive price competition, downward pressure ongross margins, continual improvement in product performance, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. The markets in which the\nCompany competes are further defined by frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, and rapidadoption of technological advancements by competitors. Many of the Company\u2019s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low\ncost structures, and by imitating the Company\u2019s products and infringing on its intellectual property.\n\u00ae\n\u00ae\n\u00ae \u00ae\n\u00ae \u00ae\n\u00ae\n\u00ae \u00ae\nApple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 2\nThe Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and\ntechnologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system,numerous software applications and related services. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features(including security features), relative price and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design and technology innovation, a strong third-party\nsoftware and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, corporate reputation, and the ability to effectively protect andenforce the Company\u2019s intellectual property rights.\nThe Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories, and services.The Company\u2019s products and services face substantial competition from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources,as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, the Company faces significant competition as\ncompetitors imitate the Company\u2019s product features and applications within their products to offer more competitive solutions. The Company also expectscompetition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company\u2019s approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer\nintegrated solutions. Some of the Company\u2019s competitors have broad product lines, low-priced products, large installed bases of active devices, and largecustomer bases. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors havethe resources, experience or cost structures to provide products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company has a minority market share in\nthe global smartphone, personal computer, tablet and wearables markets, and some of the markets in which the Company competes have from time to timeexperienced little to no growth or contracted overall.\nSupply of Components\nAlthough most components essential to the Company\u2019s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained fromsingle or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers,\ntablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at timessubject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. Restrictions on international trade can increase the cost or limit the availability of\nthe Company\u2019s products and the components and rare earths and other raw materials that go into them.\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilizecustom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the\nsuppliers\u2019 yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of manycomponents; however, the Company may not be able to extend or renew agreements for the supply of components on similar terms, or at all, and may not besuccessful in obtaining sufficient quantities from its suppliers or in a timely manner, or in identifying and obtaining sufficient quantities from an alternative source.\nIn addition, component suppliers may fail, be subject to consolidation within a particular industry, or decide to concentrate on the production of commoncomponents instead of components customized to meet the Company\u2019s requirements, further limiting the Company\u2019s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of\ncomponents on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nResearch and Development\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully\ndepends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Companycontinues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through res",
    "Risk Factors": "For example, the purchasing preferences and behaviors of consumers maychange, the financial condition of resellers could weaken, resellers could stop distributing the Company\u2019s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some orall of the Company\u2019s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company\u2019s products, all of which could materially adversely\nimpact the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. These laws and regulations can increase regulatory risks by requiring complex compliance measures and significant modifications to\nthe Company\u2019s products, services and operations, and may lead to operational disruptions, heightened privacy and data security risks, increased costs andpotential liability and fines, all of which can have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice, which can create uncertainty, and theCompany may not be able to effectively mitigate any or all adverse impacts from such measures. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have\nadversely affected, and could in the future materially adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumerproducts; the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement\nof products between regions; and disruptions in the Company\u2019s operations, supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions to thesupply of current products and offering of existing services, and delays in production ramps of new products and development of new services. Legal and Regulatory Compliance Risks\nThe Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings orgovernment investigations. If the Company fails to meet expectationsrelated to future growth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, the price of the Company\u2019s stock may decline significantly,\nwhich could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention. Risk Factors\nThe following summarizes factors that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition andstock price. The risks and uncertainties described below are not exhaustive and should not be considered a complete statement of all potential\nrisks or uncertainties that the Company faces or may face in the future. | 2025 Form 10-K | 8\nThe Company\u2019s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affectthe Company\u2019s business and result in harm to the Company\u2019s reputation. If third-\nparty software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company\u2019s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company\u2019sproducts, adversely impacting the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. Failure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company\u2019s customers, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable\nterms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the Company\u2019s business by, among other things, preventing access to the Company\u2019s online\nservices, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Company\u2019s products. Investment in new business strategies, commercial relationships and acquisitions could disrupt the Company\u2019s ongoing business, present risks notoriginally contemplated, and materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Such endeavors may involvesignificant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, economic,political, legal and regulatory challenges associated with operating in new businesses, regions or countries, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of\ntangible and intangible assets, and significant write-offs. The Company\u2019s business strategies and investmentsmay not be successful, which could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. Regulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business may be announced with little or no advance notice and the\nCompany may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. The Company\u2019s programs, policies and procedures may not be effective in preventing a violation or a claim of a violation.As a result, the Company\u2019s products could be banned, delayed or prohibited from importation, which could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business,\nreputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. The Company alsopursues environmental and other goals and initiatives that involve risks and uncertainties, require investments, and depend in part on third-party performance or\ndata that is outside the Company\u2019s control, and the Company may not be able to fully achieve all of its goals and initiatives. The Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations and litigation in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in legal proceedings and\nclaims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations,financial condition and stock price. If such investigations or litigation are resolved against theCompany, the Company can be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make further changes to its business practices, all of which could materiallyadversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. Further, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become subject to investigations andlitigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s commercial relationships with those business partners\nand materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. These and other factors could have a\nmaterially adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and stock price. Although the Company has not realized significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, futurefluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition\nand stock price. If the Company is unable to monitor and limitexposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial conditionand stock price could be materially adversely affected. The Company may not be able to accurately predict, control or mitigate these risks. Statements in this section are based on the Company\u2019s beliefs\nand opinions regarding matters that could materially adversely affect the Company in the future and are not representations as to whether such matters have orhave not occurred previously. Macroeconomic and Industry Risks\nThe Company\u2019s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions canmaterially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including slow growth or recession, high unemployment, inflation, tighter credit, higher interest rates, and currencyfluctuations, can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially adversely affect demand for the Company\u2019s products and services. Uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions can also have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s suppliers, contract manufacturers,logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners, and developers. Adverse economic conditions can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company\u2019s trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterpartiesand other financial institutions; limitations on the Company\u2019s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair values of the Company\u2019s financial\ninstruments. These and other impacts can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. Trade and other international disputes can also have an adverse impact on the overall macroeconomic environment and result in shifts\nand reductions in consumer spending and negative consumer sentiment for the Company\u2019s products and services, all of which can further adversely affect theCompany\u2019s business and results of operations. Global supply chains can be highly concentrated, and an\nescalation of geopolitical tensions or conflict could result in significant disruptions. Tariffs have been announced and further changes could be made in the future, which may include additional sector-basedtariffs or other measures. The ultimate impact remains uncertain and will depend on several factors, including whether additional or incrementalU.S. While the Company\u2019s suppliers arerequired to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption tothe Company\u2019s business, and harm to the Company\u2019s reputation.

In response, several countries have imposed, or threatened to impose, reciprocal tariffs on imports from the U.S. and other\nretaliatory measures. Various modifications to the U.S. Tariffs have been announced and further changes could be made in the future, which may includeadditional sector-based tariffs or other measures. For example, the U.S. Department of Commerce has initiated an investigation under Section 232 of the Trade\nExpansion Act of 1962, as amended, into, among other things, imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and their derivativeproducts, including downstream products that contain semiconductors. Tariffs and other measures that are applied to the Company\u2019s products or theircomponents can have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition, including impacting the Company\u2019s\nsupply chain, the availability of rare earths and other raw materials and components, pricing and gross margin. The ultimate impact remains uncertain and willdepend on several factors, including whether additional or incremental U.S. Tariffs or other measures are announced or imposed, to what extent other countries\nimplement tariffs or other retaliatory measures in response, and the overall magnitude and duration of these measures. Trade and other international disputescan have an adverse impact on the overall macroeconomic environment and result in shifts and reductions in consumer spending and negative consumersentiment for the Company\u2019s products and services, all of which can further adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nSegment Operating Performance\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2025, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in millions):\n2025 Change 2024 Change 2023\nAmericas $ 178,353 7 % $ 167,045 3 % $ 162,560 \nEurope 111,032 10 % 101,328 7 % 94,294 \nGreater China 64,377 (4)% 66,952 (8)% 72,559 \nJapan 28,703 15 % 25,052 3 % 24,257 \nRest of Asia Pacific 33,696 10 % 30,658 4 % 29,615 \nTotal net sales $ 416,161 6 % $ 391,035 2 % $ 383,285 \nAmericas\nAmericas net sales increased during 2025 compared to 2024 primarily due to higher net sales of iPhone and Services.

The Company has identified the performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac and iPad. The first materialperformance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale.The second material performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud, Siri and Maps. The\nCompany allocates revenue and any related discounts to all of its performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacksobservable prices for product-related bundled services, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company\u2019s estimated SSPs. For certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For these arrangements, theCompany does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of\nthe undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services. For the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenuebased on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products,\nincluding evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of theproduct. For third-party applications sold through the App Store, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for all third-party application\u2013related sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains. \u00ae \u00ae\nApple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 35\nThe following table shows disaggregated net sales, as well as the portion of total net sales that was previously deferred, for 2025, 2024 and 2023 (in millions):\n2025 2024 2023\niPhone $ 209,586 $ 201,183 $ 200,583 \nMac 33,708 29,984 29,357 \niPad 28,023 26,694 28,300 \nWearables, Home and Accessories 35,686 37,005 39,845 \nServices 109,158 96,169 85,200 \nTotal net sales $ 416,161 $ 391,035 $ 383,285 \nPortion of total net sales that was included in deferred revenue as of the beginning of theperiod $ 8,229 $ 7,728 $ 8,169 \n(1) Services net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products.
