Today, it also simulates human intelligence,\nenabling a deeper understanding of the physical world. Its parallel processing capabilities, supported by thousands of computing cores, are essential for deeplearning algorithms. This form of AI, in which software writes itself by learning from large amounts of data, can serve as the brain of computers, robots and self-\ndriving cars that can perceive and understand the world. GPU-powered AI solutions are being developed by thousands of enterprises to deliver services andproducts that would have been immensely difficult or even impossible with traditional coding. Examples include generative AI, which can create new contentsuch as text, code, images, audio, video, and molecule structures, and recommendation systems, which can recommend highly relevant content such as\nproducts, services, media or ads using deep neural networks trained on vast datasets that capture the user preferences.\nNVIDIA has a platform strategy, bringing together hardware, systems, software, algorithms, libraries, and services to create unique value for the markets we\nserve. While the computing requirements of these end markets are diverse, we address them with a unified underlying architecture leveraging our GPUs andnetworking and software stacks. The programmable nature of our architecture allows us to support several multi-billion-dollar end markets with the sameunderlying technology by using a variety of software stacks developed either internally or by third-party developers and partners. The large and growing number\nof developers and installed base across our platforms strengthens our ecosystem and increases the value of our platform to our customers.\nInnovation is at our core. We have invested over $45.3 billion in research and development since our inception, yielding inventions that are essential to modern\ncomputing. Our invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market and redefined computer graphics. With our introduction of the CUDAprogramming model in 2006, we opened the parallel processing capabilities of our GPU to a broad range of compute-intensive applications, paving the way forthe emergence of modern AI. In 2012, the AlexNet neural network, trained on NVIDIA GPUs, won the ImageNet computer image recognition competition,\nmarking the \u201cBig Bang\u201d moment of AI. We introduced our first Tensor Core GPU in 2017, built from the ground-up for the new era of AI, and our first autonomousdriving system-on-chips, or SoC, in 2018. Our acquisition of Mellanox in 2020 expanded our innovation canvas to include networking and led to the introductionof a new processor class \u2013 the data processing unit, or DPU. Over the past 5 years, we have built full software stacks that run on top of our GPUs and CUDA to\nbring AI to the world\u2019s largest industries, including NVIDIA DRIVE stack for autonomous driving, Clara for healthcare, and Omniverse for industrial digitalization;and introduced the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software \u2013 essentially an operating system for enterprise AI applications. In 2023, we introduced our first data center\nCPU, Grace, built for giant-scale AI and high-performance computing. With a strong engineering culture, we drive fast, yet harmonized, product and technologyinnovations in all dimensions of computing including silicon, systems, networking, software and algorithms. More than half of our engineers work on software.\nThe world\u2019s leading cloud service providers, or CSPs, and consumer internet companies use our data center-scale accelerated computing platforms to enable,\naccelerate or enrich the services they deliver to billions of end users, including AI solutions and assistants, search, recommendations, social networking, onlineshopping, live video, and translation.\nEnterprises and startups across a broad range of industries use our accelerated computing platforms to build new generative AI-enabled products and services,or to dramatically accelerate and reduce the costs of their workloads and workflows. The enterprise software industry uses them for new AI assistants andchatbots; the transportation industry for autonomous driving; the healthcare industry for accelerated and computer-aided drug discovery; and the financial\nservices industry for customer support and fraud detection.\n4\nTable of Contents\nResearchers and developers use our computing solutions to accelerate a wide range of important applications, from simulating molecular dynamics to climate\nforecasting.

    "Risk Factors": "Risk Factors\u2013 Risks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Stock and Other Matters\u201d for a discussion of this potential impact. Macroeconomic Factors\nMacroeconomic factors, including\u2009inflation, increased interest rates, capital market volatility, global supply chain constraints and global economic and geopoliticaldevelopments, may have direct and indirect impacts on our results of operations, particularly demand for our products. We did not experience any significant impact or expense to\nour business; however, if the conflict is further extended, it could impact future product development, operations, and revenue or create other uncertainty for ourbusiness. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of estimationuncertainty and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Increases in the value of the United States\u2019 dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive, which could negatively\nimpact our ability to compete. While difficult to isolate and quantify,\nthese macroeconomic factors can also impact our supply chain and manufacturing costs, employee wages, costs for capital equipment and value of ourinvestments. We believe our global supply chain for our\nnetworking products has not experienced any significant impact. Accordingly, some of our employees in Israel have been absent for an extended period and they or othersmay continue to be absent, which may cause disruption to our product development or operations. Situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory or excess product purchase commitments include changes in business and economic conditions,changes in market conditions, sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products, inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and\ncustomer requirements, new product introductions resulting in less demand for existing products or inconsistent spikes in demand, failure to estimate customerdemand properly, ordering in advance of historical lead-times, government regulations and the impact of changes in future demand, or increase in demand for\ncompetitive products, including competitive actions. We may place non-cancellable inventory orders for certain product components in advance of our historical lead times, pay premiums andprovide deposits to secure future supply and capacity. We also adjust to other market factors, such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors,\nnew product transitions, and macroeconomic conditions - all of which may impact demand for our products. If an adverse 10% foreign exchange rate change was applied to our balance sheet hedging contracts, it would have resulted in an adverse impact on incomebefore taxes of $60 million and $36 million as of January 28, 2024 and January 29, 2023, respectively. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliancewith the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Litigation, Investigation and Settlement Costs\nWe currently, are, and will likely continue to be subject to claims, litigation, and other actions, including potential regulatory proceedings, involving patent andother intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third\nparties, and other matters. However, the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be\nmaterially different from our estimates, which could require us to record additional costs. These estimates are inherently uncertain and,\ntherefore, actual results may differ from the estimates made. The amended\ncomplaint asserted that NVIDIA and certain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act,and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demandbetween May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018. As of January 28, 2024, we had federal research tax credit carryforwards of $31 million, before the impact of uncertain taxpositions, that will begin to expire in fiscal year 2025. We have state research tax credit carryforwards of $1.6 billion, before the impact of uncertain tax positions. While we believe that we have adequately provided for all tax positions, amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than our accrued position.Accordingly, our provisions on federal, state and foreign tax-related matters to be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are made or theunderlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved.

Within our supply chain, we continuously\nmanage product availability and costs with our vendors. Israel and Hamas Conflict\nWe are monitoring the impact of the geopolitical conflict in and around Israel on our operations, including the health and safety of our approximately 3,700\nemployees in the region who primarily support the research and development, operations, and sales and marketing of our networking products. Our operatingexpenses in fiscal year 2024 include expenses for financial support to impacted employees and charitable activity. Cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory. The net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was an unfavorable impact of 2.7% in fiscal year 2024and 7.5% in fiscal year 2023. Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates andjudgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based,\nin part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the U.S. and foreign income tax contingencies based on our\nestimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded taxliability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statementsaccordingly. However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates,we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to reflect our estimated exposure for product returns. For shipments to other customers, we do not allow\nreturns, although we may approve returns for credit or refund based on applicable facts and circumstances. Estimates for customer program accrualsinclude a combination of historical attainment and claim rates and may be adjusted based on relevant internal and external factors. Contracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nOur contracts may contain more than one performance obligation. Except for License and Development Arrangements, NVIDIA products and services function on a standalone basis and do not require asignificant amount of integration or interdependency. Concentration of Revenue\nRevenue by geographic region is designated based on the billing location even if the revenue may be attributable to end customers, such as enterprises andgamers in a different location. The net effect on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 2.7% and 7.5% in fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively. Other, net, consists of realized or unrealized gains and losses from investments in non-affiliated entities and the impact of changes in foreign currency rates.Change in Other, net, compared to fiscal year 2023 was driven by changes in value from our non-affiliated investments. The effective tax rate increased due to a decreased impact of tax benefits from the FDII deduction, stock-based compensation, and the U.S. The OECD, and its member countries, continue to release new guidance and legislation onPillar Two and we continue to evaluate the impact on our financial position of the global implementation of these rules. Based on enacted laws, Pillar Two is notexpected to materially impact our effective tax rate or cash flows in the next fiscal year. New legislation or guidance could change our current assessment. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirementsfor at least the next twelve months, and for the foreseeable future, including our future supply obligations and $1.3 billion of debt repayment due in fiscal year2025 and share purchases. We may pursue additional share repurchases as we\nweigh market factors and other investment opportunities.
