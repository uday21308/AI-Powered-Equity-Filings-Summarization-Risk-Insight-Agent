Our U.S. depository \ninstitution subsidiary, Goldman Sachs Bank USA (GS Bank \nUSA), is a New York State-chartered bank.\nOur Business Segments\nWe manage and report our activities in three business \nsegments: Global Banking & Markets, Asset & Wealth \nManagement and Platform Solutions. Global Banking & \nMarkets generates revenues from investment banking fees, \nincluding advisory, and equity and debt underwriting fees, \nFixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) \nintermediation and financing activities and Equities \nintermediation and financing activities, as well as \nrelationship lending and acquisition financing (and related \nhedges) and investing activities related to our Global Banking \n& Markets activities. Asset & Wealth Management generates \nrevenues from management and other fees, incentive fees, \nprivate banking and lending, equity investments and debt \ninvestments. Platform Solutions generates revenues from \nconsumer platforms and transaction banking and other.  \nThe chart below presents our three business segments and \ntheir revenue sources. \nGlobal Banking & Markets\nGlobal Banking & Markets serves public and private sector \nclients and we seek to develop and maintain long-term \nrelationships with a diverse global group of institutional \nclients, including corporations, governments, states and \nmunicipalities. Our goal is to deliver to our institutional \nclients all of our resources in a seamless fashion, with our \nadvisory and underwriting activities serving as the main \ninitial point of contact. We make markets and facilitate client \ntransactions in fixed income, currency, commodity and \nequity products and offer market expertise on a global basis. \nIn addition, we make markets in, and clear client transactions \non, major stock, options and futures exchanges worldwide. \nOur clients include companies that raise capital and funding \nto grow and strengthen their businesses, and engage in \nmergers and acquisitions, divestitures, corporate defense, \nrestructurings and spin-offs, as well as companies that are \nprofessional market participants, who buy and sell financial \nproducts and manage risk, and investment entities whose \nultimate clients include individual investors investing for \ntheir retirement, buying insurance or saving surplus cash. \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K 1\nAs a market maker, we provide prices to clients globally \nacross thousands of products in all major asset classes and \nmarkets. At times, we take the other side of transactions \nourselves if a buyer or seller is not readily available, and at \nother times we connect our clients to other parties who want \nto transact. Our willingness to make markets, commit capital \nand take risk in a broad range of products is crucial to our \nclient relationships. Market makers provide liquidity and \nplay a critical role in price discovery, which contributes to the \noverall efficiency of the capital markets. In connection with \nour market-making activities, we maintain (i) market-making \npositions, typically for a short period of time, in response to, \nor in anticipation of, client demand, and (ii) positions to \nactively manage our risk exposures that arise from these \nmarket-making activities (collectively, inventory). \nWe execute a high volume of transactions for our clients in \nlarge, highly liquid markets (such as markets for U.S. \nTreasury securities, stocks and certain agency mortgage pass-\nthrough securities). We also execute transactions for our \nclients in less liquid markets (such as mid-cap corporate \nbonds, emerging market currencies and certain non-agency \nmortgage-backed securities) for spreads and fees that are \ngenerally somewhat larger than those charged in more liquid \nmarkets. Additionally, we structure and execute transactions \ninvolving customized or tailor-made products that address \nour clients\u2019 risk exposures, investment objectives or other \ncomplex needs, as well as derivative transactions related to \nclient advisory and underwriting activities.\nThrough our global sales force, we maintain relationships \nwith our clients, receiving orders and distributing investment \nresearch, trading ideas, market information and analysis. \nMuch of this connectivity between us and our clients is \nmaintained on technology platforms, including Marquee, and \noperates globally where markets are open for trading. \nMarquee provides institutional investors with market \nintelligence, risk analytics, proprietary datasets and trade \nexecution across multiple asset classes.\nOur businesses are supported by our Global Investment \nResearch business, which, as of December 2024, provided \nfundamental research on approximately 3,000 companies \nworldwide and on approximately 50 national economies, as \nwell as on industries, currencies and commodities.\nOur activities are organized by asset class and include both \n\u201ccash\u201d and \u201cderivative\u201d instruments. \u201cCash\u201d refers to trading \nthe underlying instrument (such as a stock, bond or barrel of \noil). \u201cDerivative\u201d refers to instruments that derive their value \nfrom underlying asset prices, indices, reference rates and \nother inputs, or a combination of these factors (such as an \noption, which is the right or obligation to buy or sell a certain \nbond, stock or other asset on a specified date in the future at \na certain price, or an interest rate swap, which is the \nagreement to convert a fixed rate of interest into a floating \nrate or vice versa). \nGlobal Banking & Markets generates revenues from the \nfollowing: \nInvestment banking fees.  We provide advisory and \nunderwriting services and help companies raise capital to \nstrengthen and grow their businesses. \nInvestment banking fees includes the following:\n\u2022 Advisory. We have been a leader for many years in \nproviding advisory services, including strategic advisory \nassignments with respect to mergers and acquisitions, \ndivestitures, corporate defense activities, restructurings and \nspin-offs. In particular, we help clients execute large, \ncomplex transactions for which we provide multiple \nservices, including cross-border structuring expertise. We \nalso assist our clients in managing their asset and liability \nexposures and their capital. \n\u2022 Underwriting. We help companies raise capital to fund \ntheir businesses. As a financial intermediary, our job is to \nmatch the capital of our investing clients, who aim to grow \nthe savings of millions of people, with the needs of our \npublic and private sector clients, who need financing to \ngenerate growth, create jobs and deliver products and \nservices. Our underwriting activities include public \nofferings and private placements in both local and cross-\nborder transactions of a wide range of securities and other \nfinancial instruments, including acquisition financing. \nUnderwriting consists of the following:\nEquity underwriting. We underwrite common stock, \npreferred stock, convertible securities and exchangeable \nsecurities. We regularly receive mandates for large, \ncomplex transactions and have held a leading position in \nworldwide public common stock offerings and worldwide \ninitial public offerings for many years.\nDebt underwriting. We originate and underwrite various \ntypes of debt instruments, including investment-grade and \nhigh-yield debt, bank and bridge loans, including in \nconnection with acquisition financing, and emerging- and \ngrowth-market debt, which may be issued by, among \nothers, corporate, sovereign, municipal and agency issuers. \nIn addition, we underwrite and originate structured \nsecurities, which include mortgage-related securities and \nother asset-backed securities.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

    "Risk Factors": "General uncertainty about economic, political and market \nactivities, and the scope, timing and impact of regulatory \nreform, as well as weak consumer, investor and CEO \nconfidence resulting in large part from such uncertainty, has \nin the past negatively impacted client activity, which has in \nthe past adversely affected and could in the future adversely \naffect many of our businesses. In the ordinary course of business, we are at times subject to \na concentration of credit risk to a particular counterparty, \nborrower, issuer (including sovereign issuers) or geographic \narea or group of related countries, such as the E.U., and a \nfailure or downgrade of, or default by, such entity could \nnegatively impact our businesses, perhaps materially, and the \nsystems by which we set limits and monitor the level of our \ncredit exposure to individual entities, industries, countries \nand regions may not function as we have anticipated. Any such failure, termination or \nconstraint could adversely affect our ability to effect \ntransactions, service our clients, manage our exposure to risk \nor expand our businesses or result in financial loss or liability \nto our clients, impairment of our liquidity, disruption of our \nbusinesses, regulatory intervention or reputational damage. Legal, regulatory and \nreputational risks may also exist in connection with activities \nand transactions involving new products or markets where \nthere is regulatory uncertainty or where there are different or \nconflicting regulations depending on the regulator or the \njurisdiction involved, particularly where transactions in such \nproducts may involve multiple jurisdictions. \u2022 The development and use of AI present risks and challenges \nthat may adversely impact our business. \u2022 Substantial civil or criminal liability or significant \nregulatory action against us has in the past had and may in \nthe future have material adverse financial effects and \nsignificant reputational consequences, which in turn could \nseriously harm our business prospects. In addition, \nliquidity in the financial markets has in the past been, and \ncould in the future be, negatively impacted as market \nparticipants and market practices and structures adjust to \nevolving regulatory frameworks. could result in unprecedented \nmarket volatility and illiquidity, heightened operational risks \nrelating to the clearance and settlement of transactions, \nmargin and other disputes with clients and counterparties, an \nadverse impact to investors including money market funds \nthat invest in U.S. In addition, our need to manage our operations in \nlight of certain regulatory requirements when applicable \nthresholds are met has in the past limited and may in the \nfuture limit our ability to raise deposits in GSIB or other \nfunding, which could adversely affect our liquidity or ability \nto respond efficiently to liquidity stress. The interconnectivity of multiple financial institutions with \nagent banks, exchanges and clearinghouses, and the increased \ncentrality of these entities, increases the risk that an \noperational failure at one institution or entity may cause an \nindustry-wide operational failure that could materially \nimpact our ability to conduct business. Despite our resiliency plans and facilities, our ability to \nconduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption \nin the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the \ncommunities where we are located. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n42 Goldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nThe development and use of AI present risks and \nchallenges that may adversely impact our business. Any of these risks could \nexpose us to liability or adverse legal or regulatory \nconsequences and harm our reputation and the public \nperception of our business or the effectiveness of our security \nmeasures. Postings on these types of forums may \nalso adversely impact risk positions of our clients and other \nparties that owe us money, securities or other assets and \nincrease the chance that they will not perform their \nobligations to us or reduce the revenues we receive from their \nuse of our services. Substantial civil or criminal liability or significant \nregulatory action against us has in the past had and \nmay in the future have material adverse financial \neffects and significant reputational consequences, \nwhich in turn could seriously harm our business \nprospects. While we have invested and \ncontinue to invest significant resources in training and in \ncompliance monitoring, the geographical diversity of our \noperations, employees, clients and consumers, as well as the \nvendors and other third parties that we deal with, greatly \nincreases the risk that we may be found in violation of such \nrules or regulations and such violations have in the past and \ncould in the future subject us to significant penalties or \nadversely affect our reputation. Climate change and the transition to a less \ncarbon-dependent economy may also have a negative impact \non the operations or financial condition of our clients and \ncounterparties, which may decrease revenues from those \nclients and counterparties and increase the credit risk \nassociated with loans and other credit exposures to those \nclients and counterparties. In addition, due to divergent stakeholder views \nregarding climate change, we are at increased risk that any \nactual or perceived action, or lack thereof, by us in \nconnection with the transition to a less carbon-dependent \neconomy will be perceived negatively by some stakeholders \nand adversely affect our business and reputation. The escalation or continuation of these conflicts or other \nhostilities could result in, among other things, an increased \nrisk of cyber attacks, an increased frequency and volume of \nfailures to settle securities transactions, supply chain \ndisruptions, higher inflation, lower consumer demand and \nincreased volatility in commodity, currency and other \nfinancial markets. The following is a summary of some of the more important \nfactors that could affect our businesses:\nMarket\n\u2022 Our businesses have been and may in the future be \nadversely affected by conditions in the global financial \nmarkets and broader economic conditions. \u2022 Our investment banking, client intermediation, asset \nmanagement and wealth management businesses have been \nadversely affected and may in the future be adversely \naffected by market uncertainty or lack of confidence \namong investors and CEOs due to declines in economic \nactivity and other unfavorable economic, geopolitical or \nmarket conditions. \u2022 Our businesses have been and may in the future be \nadversely affected by disruptions or lack of liquidity in the \ncredit markets, including reduced access to credit and \nhigher costs of obtaining credit. \u2022 We may be adversely affected by increased governmental \nand regulatory scrutiny or negative publicity. Competition\n\u2022 Our results have been and may in the future be adversely \naffected by the composition of our client base. \u2022 Our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of \noperations may be adversely affected by disruptions in the \nglobal economy caused by escalating tensions between the \nU.S. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n32 Goldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nThe following are detailed descriptions of our Risk Factors \nsummarized above:\nMarket\nOur businesses have been and may in the future be \nadversely affected by conditions in the global financial \nmarkets and broader economic conditions. and other sovereign defaults; uncertainty \nconcerning fiscal or monetary policy, government shutdowns, \ndebt ceilings or funding; the extent of and uncertainty about \npotential changes in tax rates and regulatory changes; \nlimitations on international trade and travel; changes in \nimmigration policies; laws and regulations that limit trading \nin, or the issuance of, securities of issuers outside their \ndomestic markets; outbreaks or worsening of domestic or \ninternational tensions or hostilities, terrorism, nuclear \nproliferation, cybersecurity threats or attacks and other \nforms of disruption to or curtailment of global \ncommunication, energy transmission or transportation \nnetworks or other geopolitical instability or uncertainty; \ncorporate, political or other scandals that reduce investor \nconfidence in capital markets; extreme weather events or \nother natural disasters; or a combination of these or other \nfactors. In addition, concerns about actual or \npotential increases in interest rates, inflation and other \nborrowing costs, a public health emergency, sovereign debt \nrisk and its impact on the relevant sovereign banking system, \nand limitations on international trade, have, at times, \nnegatively impacted the levels of client activity. Financial institution returns may be negatively impacted by \nincreased funding costs due in part to the lack of perceived \ngovernment support of such institutions in the event of future \nfinancial crises relative to financial institutions in countries in \nwhich governmental support is maintained. Certain of our market-making activities depend on market \nvolatility to provide trading and arbitrage opportunities to \nour clients, and decreases in volatility have reduced and may \nin the future reduce these opportunities and the level of client \nactivity associated with them and have adversely affected and \nmay in the future adversely affect the results of these \nactivities. Our investment banking, client intermediation, asset \nmanagement and wealth management businesses \nhave been adversely affected and may in the future be \nadversely affected by market uncertainty or lack of \nconfidence among investors and CEOs due to \ndeclines in economic activity and other unfavorable \neconomic, geopolitical or market conditions. In certain circumstances, market uncertainty or general \ndeclines in market or economic activity may adversely affect \nour client intermediation businesses by decreasing levels of \noverall activity or by decreasing volatility. In addition, climate change may \nimpact the broader economy.",

In addition, we \nmaintain (i) market-making positions, typically for a short \nperiod of time, in response to, or in anticipation of, client \ndemand, and (ii) positions to actively manage our risk \nexposures that arise from these market-making activities \n(collectively, inventory). Our inventory is recorded in trading \nassets (long positions) or trading liabilities (short positions) \nin our consolidated balance sheets. THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\n72 Goldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nOur results are influenced by a combination of \ninterconnected drivers, including (i) client activity levels and \ntransactional bid/offer spreads (collectively, client activity), \nand (ii) changes in the fair value of our inventory and interest \nincome and interest expense related to the holding, hedging \nand funding of our inventory (collectively, market-making \ninventory changes). Due to the integrated nature of our \nmarket-making activities, disaggregation of net revenues into \nclient activity and market-making inventory changes is \njudgmental and has inherent complexities and limitations. In general, assuming all other market-making conditions \nremain constant, increases in client activity levels or bid/offer \nspreads tend to result in increases in net revenues, and \ndecreases tend to have the opposite effect. However, changes \nin market-making conditions can materially impact client \nactivity levels and bid/offer spreads, as well as the fair value \nof our inventory. Other.

    "Outlook": "outlook, market consensus, recent \nmacroeconomic conditions and industry trends. The allowance for loan \nlosses for wholesale loans that do not share similar risk \ncharacteristics, such as nonaccrual loans, is calculated using \nthe present value of expected future cash flows discounted at \nthe loan\u2019s effective rate, the observable market price of the \nloan, or, in the case of collateral dependent loans, the fair \nvalue of the collateral less estimated costs to sell, if \napplicable. Personnel \nwithin Risk are responsible for forecasting the economic \nvariables that underlie the economic scenarios that are used \nin the modeling of expected credit losses. To estimate the potential impact of an adverse \nmacroeconomic environment on our allowance for credit \nlosses, we, among other things, compared the expected credit \nlosses under the weighted average forecast used in the \ncalculation of allowance for credit losses as of December \n2024 (which was weighted towards the baseline and adverse \neconomic scenarios) to the expected credit losses under a \n100% weighted adverse economic scenario. The \nforecasted economic scenarios consider a number of risk \nfactors relevant to the wholesale and consumer portfolios. Risk factors for wholesale loans include internal credit \nratings, industry default and loss data, expected life, \nmacroeconomic indicators (e.g., unemployment rates and \nGDP), the borrower\u2019s capacity to meet its financial \nobligations, the borrower\u2019s country of risk and industry, loan \nseniority and collateral type. The allowance for credit losses also includes qualitative \ncomponents which allow management to reflect the uncertain \nnature of economic forecasting, capture uncertainty \nregarding model inputs, and account for model imprecision \nand concentration risk. The qualitative factors considered by \nmanagement include, among others, changes and trends in \nloan portfolios, uncertainties associated with the \nmacroeconomic and geopolitical environments, credit \nconcentrations, changes in volume and severity of past due \nand criticized loans, idiosyncratic events and deterioration \nwithin an industry or region. While we use the \nbest information available to determine this estimate, future \nadjustments to the allowance may be necessary based on, \namong other things, changes in the economic environment or \nvariances between actual results and the original assumptions \nused. The adverse \neconomic scenario of the forecast model reflects a global \nrecession in the first quarter of 2025 through the first quarter \nof 2026, resulting in an economic contraction and rising \nunemployment rates. The forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are \ninherently uncertain and do not take into account any other \noffsetting or correlated effects. If we experience a \nprolonged or severe period of weakness in the business \nenvironment, financial markets, the performance of one or \nmore of our reporting units or our common stock price, or \nadditional increases in capital requirements, our goodwill \ncould be impaired in the future. In addition, for loans backed by \nreal estate, risk factors include the loan-to-value ratio, debt \nservice ratio and home price index. Risk factors for installment and credit card loans \ninclude Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit scores, \ndelinquency status, loan vintage and macroeconomic \nindicators. Our estimate of credit losses entails judgment about \ncollectability at the reporting dates, and there are \nuncertainties inherent in those judgments. The allowance for \ncredit losses is subject to a governance process that involves \nsenior management within Risk and Controllers. Loans are charged off against the allowance for loan \nlosses when deemed to be uncollectible. We also record an allowance for credit losses on lending \ncommitments which are held for investment that are \naccounted for at amortized cost. Such allowance is \ndetermined using the same methodology as the allowance for \nloan losses, while also taking into consideration the \nprobability of drawdowns or funding, and whether such \ncommitments are cancellable by us. A 100% weighting to the adverse \neconomic scenario would have resulted in an approximate \n$0.9 billion  increase in our allowance for credit losses as of \nDecember 2024. This hypothetical increase does not take into \nconsideration any potential adjustments to qualitative \nreserves. The actual credit loss in an \nadverse macroeconomic environment may differ significantly \nfrom this estimate. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial \nstatements for further information about the allowance for \ncredit losses. Use of Estimates \nU.S. GAAP requires us to make certain estimates and \nassumptions. In addition to the estimates we make in \nconnection with fair value measurements and the allowance \nfor credit losses on loans and lending commitments held for \ninvestment and accounted for at amortized cost, the use of \nestimates and assumptions is also important in determining \nthe accounting for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, \nprovisions for losses that may arise from litigation and \nregulatory proceedings (including governmental \ninvestigations), and accounting for income taxes. THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\n66 Goldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nGoodwill is assessed for impairment annually in the fourth \nquarter or more frequently if events occur or circumstances \nchange that indicate an impairment may exist. When \nassessing goodwill for impairment, first, a qualitative \nassessment can be made to determine whether it is more \nlikely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting \nunit is less than its carrying value. If the results of the \nqualitative assessment are not conclusive, a quantitative \ngoodwill test is performed. Alternatively, a quantitative \ngoodwill test can be performed without performing a \nqualitative assessment. Estimating the fair value of our \nreporting units requires judgment. Critical inputs to the fair \nvalue estimates include projected earnings, allocated equity, \nprice-to-earnings multiples and price-to-book multiples. There is inherent uncertainty in the projected earnings. The \ncarrying value of each reporting unit reflects an allocation of \ntotal shareholders\u2019 equity and represents the estimated \namount of total shareholders\u2019 equity required to support the \nactivities of the reporting unit under currently applicable \nregulatory capital requirements. During the third quarter of \n2024, in connection with the planned sale of our seller \nfinancing loan portfolio, we performed a quantitative \ngoodwill test and determined that the goodwill associated \nwith Transaction banking and other was impaired, and \naccordingly, recorded a $14 million impairment. In the fourth \nquarter of 2024, we performed our annual assessment of \ngoodwill for impairment, for each of our reporting units with \ngoodwill, by performing a qualitative assessment. As a result \nof the  annual assessment, we determined that it was more \nlikely than not that the estimated fair value of each reporting \nunit with goodwill exceeded its respective carrying value. Therefore, we determined that goodwill for each reporting \nunit was not impaired and that a quantitative goodwill test \nwas not required. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial \nstatements for further information about our annual \nassessment of goodwill for impairment. Identifiable intangible assets are tested for impairment when \nevents or changes in circumstances suggest that an asset\u2019s or \nasset group\u2019s carrying value may not be fully recoverable. Judgment is required to evaluate whether indications of \npotential impairment have occurred, and to test identifiable \nintangible assets for impairment, if required. An impairment \nis recognized if the estimated undiscounted cash flows \nrelating to the asset or asset group is less than the \ncorresponding carrying value.
